All voters in Wisconsin will participate in the primary, since three candidates are running in a statewide race for superintendent of public instruction. Two will advance to the April 1 general election. You might have also heard about a state Supreme Court race this spring. Only two candidates are running, meaning there's no primary for that race. Depending on where you live, you may have a primary for other local, nonpartisan races on your ballot, like circuit court judges, city council members or school board members. Here's what to know about what's on the ballot in Wisconsin's spring elections, and important voting deadlines to keep in mind: Three candidates are running for state superintendent — the state's top education official. That's a statewide position, so all Wisconsin voters will participate in that primary election. Incumbent Jill Underly is seeking a second term. She's endorsed by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Jeff Wright, a Democrat and the Sauk Prairie School District superintendent, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant, are challenging Underly. The political action committee of the Wisconsin Education Association Council — the state's largest teachers' union — recommended Wright receive the organization's endorsement. Kinser declined to tell the Journal Sentinel her party affiliation. She previously led Wisconsin's Rocketship schools, which are part of a national network of public charter schools. More: 3 candidates file paperwork to run for state superintendent of public instruction, prompting February primary Some voters may see additional primaries on their ballot, if more than two candidates are running for a local office. For example, in the Cedarburg, Hartland-Lakeside and Oak Creek-Franklin school districts, there are several candidates running for school board seats. Voters on Milwaukee's east side will see a primary of eight candidates hoping to represent the 3rd District on the Common Council, which was left vacant after the death of Ald. Jonathan Brostoff. You can always check to see which races and candidates are on your upcoming ballot by using the ""What's on my Ballot"" feature at myvote.wi.gov. Sample ballots are typically ready 21 days before state and local elections. Wisconsin voters will again determine whether the state Supreme Court remains under liberal control or switches to a conservative majority in the April 1 election. Since only two candidates are running, the race isn't on the Feb. 18 primary ballot. Liberal Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford and former Republican state attorney general Brad Schimel — who's also a conservative Waukesha County judge — are vying for the open seat. Ann Walsh Bradley, a longtime liberal justice, is retiring from the court. The past two Supreme Court elections in Wisconsin had primaries, including a four-candidate race in 2023 with two liberal and two conservative candidates. More: Missing all the political ads? With no primary, Supreme Court race will kick into high gear All voters in Wisconsin are also set to weigh in on a statewide referendum question April 1, asking whether Wisconsin's photo identification requirement to vote should be enshrined in the state constitution. Republicans scheduled the referendum question for the April 1 election in part because they're concerned the state Supreme Court could overturn Wisconsin's voter ID law. They have pointed out Crawford's work as an attorney representing plaintiffs challenging the state's voter ID law. More: Wisconsin voters saw 5 statewide referendums in 2024. They might see 4 more in 2025. Here's what they are. Voters will also make their final selections for local, nonpartisan offices, including circuit court judges, municipal judges, county executives, county supervisors, city council members and school board members. Some local governments or school districts may place funding referendums on the April 1 ballot.
