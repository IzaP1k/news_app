This agreement must now be implemented to the letter. All of the hostages must be released. The mortal remains of the deceased must also be handed over to the families for a dignified burial. This ceasefire opens the door to a permanent end to the war and to the improvement of the poor humanitarian situation in Gaza. We are continuing to work toward this."" The mortal remains of the deceased must also be handed over to the families for a dignified burial.

We are continuing to work towards this. 2/2 â€” Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) January 15, 2025 Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission ""I warmly welcome the ceasefire and hostage release agreement in Gaza. Hostages will be reunited with their loved ones and humanitarian aid can reach civilians in Gaza. This brings hope to an entire region, where people have endured immense suffering for far too long. Both parties must fully implement this agreement, as a stepping stone toward lasting stability in the region and a diplomatic resolution of the conflict.""

They have borne the brunt of this conflict â€” triggered by the brutal terrorists of Hamas, who committed the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust on October 7th, 2023. The hostages, who were brutally ripped from their homes on that day and held captive in unimaginable conditions ever since, can now finally return to their families. But we should use this moment to pay tribute to those who won't make it home â€” including the British people who were murdered by Hamas. ""We will continue to mourn and remember them. For the innocent Palestinians whose homes turned into a warzone overnight and the many who have lost their lives, this ceasefire must allow for a huge surge in humanitarian aid, which is so desperately needed to end the suffering in Gaza. And then our attention must turn to how we secure a permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people â€” grounded in a two-state solution that will guarantee security and stability for Israel, alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine state. The UK and its allies will continue to be at the forefront of these crucial efforts to break the cycle of violence and secure long-term peace in the Middle East.""

With this agreement, I emphasize the importance of accelerating the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis, without any hindrances, until a sustainable peace is achieved through the two-state solution, and for the region to enjoy stability, security and development in a world that is large enough for everyone. Egypt will always remain committed to its pledge, supporting a just peace, being a loyal partner in achieving it, and defending the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."" Barack Obama, former president of the United States ""The ceasefire and hostage release deal announced between Israel and Hamas is good news â€“ for the families of the hostages taken on October 7th, for the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for more than a year, and for everyone who has prayed for an end to this awful chapter. Itâ€™s important to recognize that no deal â€“ including this one â€“ can ease the pain of those who have lost loved ones, or resolve the longstanding conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. ""That work will be much harder, and take much longer. But it will put a stop to the bloodshed, allow people to return to their homes, and get much-needed aid to more than a million desperate, hungry people. Thatâ€™s something we should all support, and Iâ€™m grateful to President Biden, Secretary Blinken, and all the leaders and diplomatic teams from around the world who have worked so hard to get this done."" The ceasefire and hostage release deal announced between Israel and Hamas is good news â€“ for the families of the hostages taken on October 7th, for the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for more than a year, and for everyone who has prayed for an end to this awful chapter.â€¦ â€” Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 15, 2025 Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada ""Canada welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and we will support every effort to see it implemented. We urge the parties to act immediately. All the hostages must be returned home. The horrific violence and suffering must end. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza must end. There is more work ahead, but today there is hope â€” for a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely within internationally recognized borders, and with peace, dignity, and security.""
