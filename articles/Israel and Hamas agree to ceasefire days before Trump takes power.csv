Donald Trump hailed the “epic deal” on Wednesday night, claiming that it could only have happened because of his election victory in November. Hostages will be swapped for Hamas prisoners held in Israel over the course of months under the deal, which has been separated into three separate phases. Click here for Thursday’s live blog on Israel-Hamas deal It will end with a permanent ceasefire, the full military withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of hostages and remains from Hamas tunnels. Joe Biden, the US president, also took credit for the deal from White House on Wednesday night, saying “my diplomacy” forced the agreement. Civilians celebrated on the streets of Tel Aviv and Gaza alike after the deal was announced, despite reports of additional 11th-hour demands by Hamas. The Israeli cabinet was set to vote the deal through on Thursday. The first phase of the deal will last six weeks and will see 33 hostages, including women and children, released. The Israeli military will leave populated areas during that time. The second phase will see remaining male hostages released and the withdrawal of remaining Israeli forces. The third phase will see the bodies of murdered hostages returned to their families, and the reconstruction of Gaza. Mr Biden said the road to the deal “has not been easy” and that the negotiations had been complicated by attacks on Israel from Iran and Hezbollah. “This is one of the toughest negotiations I have ever experienced,” he said. The American negotiating team was formed of US government officials and Mr Trump’s team, who worked together to secure an agreement in line with ceasefire plans outlined by Mr Biden in May. Mr Trump claimed credit for the agreement, arguing that his election victory in November had “[sic] signalled to the entire world that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies”. The president-elect, who will take office on Monday, sent his Middle East envoy to Doha earlier this week to secure the ceasefire before his inauguration on Jan 20. He warned that Hamas would have “hell to pay” if it did not release the hostages. Any agreement still needs to be approved by the Israeli cabinet, but the first stage of the truce is expected to come into effect with the backing of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. Asked whether he or Mr Trump should take credit for the deal, Mr Biden replied: “Is that a joke?” Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said the world’s attention must now switch to securing a “permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution”. But Ehud Olmert, the former Israel prime minister, said he had “doubt and fear” that the deal would bring an end to the war because not all Israeli hostages would be freed under its terms. “There is not really an agreement about a permanent ceasefire,” he told Sky News. “There is an agreement for a temporary ceasefire, for I think about 42 days, maybe six weeks, and the return of only 33 hostages. “There are still more hostages [not released] and we do not know how many will be alive when this [first] phase will end.” Families of British citizens murdered by Hamas warned that there would “never be any closure” until all hostages are returned. Ayelet Svatitzky, who lost her brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell, said: “We’ll be worried and we’re not able to move on until the last hostage is home.” Stephen Brisley, whose sister Lianne Sharabi was killed with her daughters Noiya and Yahel, warned that the deal had “many moving parts that could very easily fall apart”. “Because there have been so many false dawns, there’s still that part of me that isn’t really allowing myself to believe it still, despite the fact that it’s been formally announced,” he said. The ceasefire deal raises questions about the governance of Gaza, where both Israel and the US say Hamas cannot continue to rule. Marco Rubio, the incoming Secretary of State, said in response to the announcement that Israel “cannot coexist with armed elements who seek [its] destruction and evisceration as a state”. Negotiations over the second phase of the ceasefire are expected to begin almost immediately after the first phase comes into force. Israeli troops that withdraw from Gaza will be stationed on the border between the territories, ready to receive hostages released by Hamas. The Israeli government said that Hamas introduced eleventh-hour demands for the IDF to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land between Gaza and Egypt. Mr Netanyahu’s office said Hamas had “folded” due to his “strong insistence” that the troops remain in the short term. Thanks for tuning in to our coverage of Israel’s ceasefire deal with Hamas. This liveblog is now closed. Israeli political leaders have called on Benjamin Netanyahu to approve the hostage-ceasefire deal in a vote scheduled for tomorrow. President Isaac Herzog said he supports the prime minister and the negotiating team for its efforts to reach a deal and said the cabinet must approve the deal “to bring our sons and daughters home”. “There is no higher Jewish value than returning captives home,” he added. Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s opposition, also voiced a note of caution, stating: “An entire country is holding its breath tonight.” Mr Netanyahu has made no public on the deal so far, but had previously insisted that he will not agree to permanently end the war until Hamas’ military capabilities have been dismantled. President Joe Biden said that his negotiators and Donald Trump’s incoming administration worked  as “one team” to get the ceasefire deal agreed. “This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration,” Mr Biden said, taking care to note the responsibility on the incoming president to see the deal through to its conclusion. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” Mr Biden continued. “This has been a time of real turmoil in the Middle East, but as I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and those are genuine opportunities for a new future.” President Joe Biden has pledged to bring home the remaining American hostages as part of the ceasefire deal. “I am also if thinking of the American families, three of whom have living hostages in Gaza and four awaiting return of remains after what has been the most horrible ordeal imaginable,” he said. “Under this deal, we are determined to bring all of them home.” Seven American hostages are still being held in Gaza. The three Americans presumed to be alive are Edan Alexander, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, while four others have been declared dead and their remains have yet to be returned. Families of Israeli hostages issued a statement through the Hostages and Missing Families Forum sharing their “overwhelming joy and relief” over the cease-fire deal. The statement also expressed “deep anxiety and concerns” about the possibility of some hostages being left behind. “We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out,” the statement said. President Joe Biden praised members of his administration who brokered the ceasefire deal, saying: “blessed are the peacemakers”. Taken a degree of personal credit for the agreement, Mr Biden said that he had laid out the “precise contours” of the deal last May and that that proposal was supported by the UN Security Council. He also thanked members of his administration for the “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy”. “Many peacemakers help make this deal happen, including an extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked non stop for months to get this done,” he said, citing the efforts of secretary of state Anthony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and vice president Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden has said the ceasefire deal will enable aid to flow into Gaza after months of pressure from humanitarian groups. “This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,” Mr Biden said in a statement. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said that the world’s attention must now switch to securing a “permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution”. Sir Keir said in a statement: “After months of devastating bloodshed and countless lives lost, this is the long-overdue news that the Israeli and Palestinian people have desperately been waiting for. They have borne the brunt of this conflict – triggered by the brutal terrorists of Hamas, who committed the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust on October 7th, 2023. “For the innocent Palestinians whose homes turned into a warzone overnight and the many who have lost their lives, this ceasefire must allow for a huge surge in humanitarian aid, which is so desperately needed to end the suffering in Gaza. And then our attention must turn to how we secure a permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution that will guarantee security and stability for Israel, alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine state. The Prime Minister also paid tribute to British hostages killed by Hamas. “We will continue to mourn and remember them,” he said. President Joe Biden has taken personal credit for the ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hamas, saying “this is a ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring”. In a press conference addressing the deal, Mr Biden said: “The road to this deal has not been easy. I worked in foreign policy for decades. This is one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced, and reached this point because of the pressure of Israel built on Hamas backed by ther United States.” Asked by reporters whether Mr Biden or his successor, president-elect Donald Trump, was responsible for brokering the deal, Mr Biden said: “Is that a joke?” Hamas cannot be left to govern Gaza, Marco Rubio has said. The Florida senator, who Donald Trump has picked as his secretary of state, said that Hamas cannot remain in power in Gaza following the announcement of a ceasefire with Israel. Appearing at his confirmation hearing, Mr Rubio said: “You can’t turn it [Gaza] over to people who seek your destruction. “You cannot coexist with armed elements who seek your destruction and evisceration as a state.” Mr Rubio, who has been a staunch ally of Israel, added that the peace deal brokered by the US presents a “historic opportunity” for achieving peace in the war-torn region. He said: “The good news is that potentially, we have had a dynamic shift in the region that has an historic opportunity, if appropriately structured and pursued, that changes the dynamics of what might be possible.” Among the possibilities suggested by Mr Rubio was the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s prime minister, has confirmed some of the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas. The first phase of the agreement will last for 42 days, bringing in a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the east - away from populated areas. “Israeli forces will then be positioned along the Gaza border which will allow for the swap of prisoners as well as the swap of remains and the return of the displaced people to their residences,” he added. Al Thani said 33 Israeli hostages will be released by Hamas in return for “a number of prisoners who are being held in Israeli prisons”. Joe Biden has confirmed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in a statement posted on X. “My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done – I will speak more about this soon,” the outgoing US president said. It comes after Donald Trump confirmed the hostage deal in a post on his Truth social. Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done – I will speak more about this soon. pic.twitter.com/iETWhGXEGA — President Biden (@POTUS) January 15, 2025 The ceasefire will take effect from Jan 19, according to the Qatari PM - the day before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Exact timings are yet to be confirmed. A reminder, this deal still needs to be signed off by the Israeli cabinet. Qatar’s prime minister has confirmed a ceasefire deal has been agreed between Israel and Hamas and that it will involve the release of Israeli hostages. A press conference involving the prime minister Qatar has begun. We’ll bring you updates as they come in. You can also watch the conference at the top of this page. Israeli forces will withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor - a strategic ribbon of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt - and complete it no later than day 50 of the truce, according to a copy of the deal, obtained by Reuters. Benjamin Netanyahu forced Hamas to fold on its it final demands at the last hour, his office said in a statement. “Due to the strong insistence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas folded on its last-minute demand to change the deployment of IDF forces in the Philadelphi Corridor. However, several items in the framework have yet to be finalized; we hope that the details will be finalized tonight.” Egyptian state media has reported that talks are underway to “open the Palestinian Rafah crossing to allow the entry of international aid” into Gaza, citing an Egyptian security source. Egypt was “preparing to bring in the largest possible amount of aid to the Gaza Strip”, the report said, following news of the ceasefire deal. There are several “minor” issues being finalised over the ceasefire and hostage deal that will be sorted before it is implemented, a senior official involved in the talks told The Times of Israel. The issues include Israel finishing vetting the 1,000 Palestinian prisoners slated to be released under the deal, the official said. An Israeli air strike killed five Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin Wednesday, the local health ministry said shortly after news broke of a ceasefire deal in Gaza. The majority of Israelis will be celebrating the ceasefire but with a certain bittersweet feeling. Many of the hostages are dead, hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed and the Hamas members with blood on their hands are going to be released from Israeli jails. Benjamin Netanyahu will undoubtedly boost his popularity when the hostages are released, but for most Israelis he remains a villain who puts his own personal interest above the nation’s. Hamas has been significantly weakened and lost control over Gaza. Rebuilding the organisation will take years, and many Palestinians will hold them responsible for the dearth and destruction they brought on Gaza. The only real winner in all this is the Palestinian Authority, which is preparing to position itself as the next ruler of Gaza. But the road to power in the enclave is long and full of challenges. “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies. I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones. “With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven. We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World! “We have achieved so much without even being in the White House. Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!” The long-awaited truce agreement “could not come soon enough,” said Dr Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, adding that it was Donald Trump’s “pressure tactics” that brought it over the finish line. “Donald Trump’s pressure tactics and warnings to Hamas and Israel have clearly been effective in reviving the drawn-out negotiations where the Biden administration proved unwilling to exert adequate pressure over Israel’s leadership,” she said. Dr Vakil also noted that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, also managed to silence opposition from hard-Right ministers “to deliver a ceasefire arrangement that would have benefitted Trump.” “Netanyahu also hopes to gain by seizing the momentum of Israeli gains across the region and further influencing the incoming US team to support more military efforts to set back Iran’s nuclear programme,” she added. Israel’s government will vote on the hostage and ceasefire deal on Wednesday, an Israeli government official told Reuters. The vote will take place at 11:00am local time (9am GMT) on Wednesday, according to Israeli media reports. Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages, including all women (soldiers and civilians), children and men over 50. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a six-week initial ceasefire phase. This includes the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from central Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to north Gaza, an official briefed on the talks told Reuters. The ceasefire deal has been reached, the Axios news website, citing a US official, said. Gideon Saar, Israel’s foreign minister, has cut short his diplomatic visit to Italy due to the progress made in the Gaza truce talks. In a statement, the foreign ministry said Mr Saar will return to Israel tonight to take part in the expected security cabinet and government votes on a deal. He had been scheduled to travel to Hungary tomorrow to attend further diplomatic talks. The Qatari update expected to have begun at 7pm local time (4pm GMT) has been delayed. Qatar’s prime minister is expected to make a hostage deal announcement tonight, with Qatari media reports suggesting he will say the deal has been signed. The country has been hosting the talks in Doha to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, which now appears imminent. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who is also foreign minister, will confirm that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement, Qatari outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported. The conference had been due to start at 4pm GMT, but has now been delayed. Ruwaida Amer, who lives in Gaza, spoke of the excitement of a deal edging closer but said she and her friends “don’t have the energy to wait one more day”. “People are very excited for this moment, they want to get back to their homes and be with their loved ones again…I want to return to the north, to get to Gaza City, my people are there, all my life was there,” she told The Telegraph. “But people are also worried that there could be problems that stop this agreement from happening today or tomorrow. “The feelings here are complex between happy and worried. .. The bombing is very hard, for us in Gaza, we know the last hours of the war could be the hardest, people are trying not to move because they do not want to die in the last moments of this war before a ceasefire.” Israeli air strikes in Gaza have continued as a ceasefire with Hamas edges closer. Palestinians have been pictured inspecting the aftermath of a strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, earlier on Wednesday. The Israeli military, the Shin Bet internal intelligence agency and the air force attacked about 50 targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours, Shin Bet and the military confirmed in a statement, killing at least 13 people. Those included seven people who were in a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, and six others killed in separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah, Bureij camp and Rafah, medics said. Hamas has only given “verbal approval” to a Gaza ceasefire proposal under negotiation in Qatar, an anonymous Palestinian official told Reuters on Wednesday. The Palestinian terror group was waiting for “more information” before giving a final written approval, the official added. Members of the Bibas family, the relatives of two children being held hostage in Gaza along with their mother, said they were aware of reports that their loved ones could be released under an imminent ceasefire deal. However, they said they consider “nothing final” until their relatives cross the Israeli border. “Given our experience with disappointments, we consider nothing final until our loved ones cross the border,” a spokesman said. “We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and condition, and request not to be contacted during this sensitive time. We ask that people refrain from spreading rumors. We continue to appeal to the Prime Minister and demand the return of everyone, until the last hostage is home.” Just minutes after an Israeli official briefed that Hamas had given the green light to the ceasefire deal, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office quickly moved to torpedo the report. The statement once again showed the chaotic nature of the leaks coming from all parties involved in the negotiates. The endless stream of leaks and reports have previously caused damaged to talks, with both Hamas and Mr Netanyahu accusing the other of sabotage. With so many officials from different countries deeply involved in negotiations, the leaks are often closely linked to their individual self-interests and attempts to dominate the narrative. Civilians in Gaza and the families of hostages in Israel are, as usual, the ones caught in the emotional roller coaster. Republican Senator Tom Cotton has launched a scathing attack on the Biden administration over the proposed ceasefire-hostages deal in Gaza. “Why is lame duck Joe Biden trying to cram down a bad deal on Israel on his way out the door? “ the senator for Arkansas wrote on X, adding: “The only “deal” should be unconditional surrender by Hamas”. The senator took issue with reports that Israel would be releasing “dozens of hardened terrorists for every one hostage”. “Here’s the ‘deal’ to offer Hamas and its patron, Iran: you have five days to release ALL the hostages or we ‘unleash hell’,” he said. Hamas must be fully destroyed and can play no part in the governance of Gaza, Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser has warned. Speaking to the Call Me Back podcast with Dan Senor, Mike Waltz criticised the Biden administration for “tapping the breaks” on arming Israel and pledged firmer support. “We’ve been clear that Gaza has to be fully demilitarised, Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute,” he said, adding: “These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist, torturers that never should ever have any role in governing.” The incoming adviser’s intervention comes at a tense time for negotiations in Doha, as Israeli officials appeared to contradict each other in statements on the progress of the deal. Finance Minister and security cabinet member Betzalel Smotrich issued a statement on Wednesday morning, saying Israel is at a “crucial and fateful moment for the security, future and existence of the State of Israel.” “What stands before me is only one thing, which I pursue with awe and reverence: how to achieve the full goals of the war – a complete victory, the total destruction of Hamas, both on its military wing and civilian [infrastructure] and the return of all hostages,” Mr Smotrich said. The Religious Zionism party leader has previously railed against a deal with Hamas, claiming it endangers Israel’s security by giving concessions to the terror group. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, called on Mr Smotrich on Tuesday to inform Benjamin Netanyahu that they would both leave the government if a ceasefire is reached. The Palestinian Authority must be the sole governing power in Gaza after the war, the Palestinian prime minister said on Wednesday. Speaking at a conference in Norway, Mohammed Mustafa said: “While we’re waiting for the ceasefire, it’s important to stress that it will not be acceptable for any entity to govern Gaza Strip but the legitimate Palestinian leadership and the government of the State of Palestine.” He added: “We are the government of Palestine, ready to hold our responsibilities in the Gaza Strip as we did before.” Israel has opposed any involvement by PA, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago which lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas in 2007. Israeli officials have accused the PA of supporting attacks against Israel and expressed concern that any Palestinian state would inevitably be taken over by the Islamist group. Pete Hegseth, president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defence secretary, has declared his support for “destroying” Hamas. Speaking at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, the former Fox news host said: “I support Israel destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.” Mr Hegseth’s opening statement was interrupted by a series of hecklers branding him “a Christian Zionist” who “supports the war in Gaza by the Zionists.” The 44-year-old responded: “I’m a Christian and I robustly support the State of Israel and its existential defence.” An Islamic Jihad official told AFP on Wednesday that a delegation from the Palestinian militant group had arrived in Qatar to participate in talks on the ceasefire in Gaza and prisoner exchange with Israel. “A high-ranking delegation from Islamic Jihad arrived in Doha on Tuesday evening,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that “discussions are ongoing, focusing on the mechanism for implementing the ceasefire agreement and the names of Palestinian prisoners included in the exchange deal”. The group is thought to have captured and held a number of hostages separately from Hamas. The Kremlin said it was following progress towards a ceasefire in Gaza with “cautious optimism”, adding that a truce between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory was “extremely necessary for the people of Gaza”. “It can only be viewed with cautious optimism,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday of steps towards a ceasefire deal. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza s,has aid that 62 people were killed in the Palestinian territory in the past 24 hours, taking the Palestinian death toll to 46,707. The ministry said at least 110,265 people have been wounded in more than 15 months of conflict between Israel and Hamas, triggered by the Palestinian group’s Oct 7, 2023 attack. An Israeli diplomatic source has accused Hamas of fabricating claims that Israel is seeking to delay the ceasefire-hostage deal with last-minute demands. “Hamas is falsely claiming that Israel added new demands in the talks to avoid finalising the deal,” the source told The Telegraph. Negotiating teams in Doha had previously indicated that a deal was hours or days away from being signed, but no final agreement has been announced and cracks have started to appear. Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of attempting to sabotage the ceasefire-hostage deal by a senior Palestinian source speaking to the Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news agency. The anonymous source claimed the Israeli prime minister insisted at the last minute that Israeli soldiers held hostage by Hamas were included in the list of 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the agreement. According to a copy of the agreement obtained by the Associated Press, the first stage would see the release of all civilian hostages and five female soldiers. For every civilian hostage freed, 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released, while each Israeli female soldier would warrant 50 Palestinian prisoners - including 30 serving life sentences. General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command that oversees operations in the Middle East, was in Israel for talks with his Israeli counterpart Herzi Halevi. “The commanders held a strategic meeting that focused on the regional situational assessment and examined courses of action to address threats and developments in the Middle East,” the military said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the general had arrived in Israel on Monday. “The two discussed a variety of possible scenarios on both near and distant fronts, emphasising the strengthening of operational cooperation and enhancing readiness for any scenario,” the military added. The first stage of the proposed truce, which is expected to last six weeks, would see Hamas release 33 of the 94 Israeli hostages held in Gaza. In return, Israel would release around 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, withdraw troops from populated areas of Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to flood in. Negotiators in Doha are still finalising the exact parameters of the IDF’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, Arab officials told the Times of Israel. Read the full story on how the truce is expected to be implemented here.  Mohammed Mustafa, the Palestinian prime minister, has urged the international community to exert pressure on Israel after an imminent ceasefire in Gaza so it accepts the creation of a Palestinian state. “The ceasefire we’re talking about ... came about primarily because of international pressure. So pressure does pay off,” Mr Mustafa told a conference in Oslo. Israel must “be shown what’s right and what’s wrong, and that the veto power on peace and statehood for Palestinians will not be accepted and tolerated any longer,” he added. Israel has warned institutions such as hospitals that it should prepare to receive a number of hostages starting on Sunday, according to Israeli broadcaster Channel 12. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the Health Ministry’s public health division, told Israeli outlet Ynet that the condition of hostages returning after more than a year in captivity will be “very different” to when Hamas released 105 civilians in late November 2023. After a deal has been announced, it will be submitted to the Israeli government for approval. A list of names of the Palestinian prisoners set for release will then be published, to which the public have 48 hours to object before the deal is implemented, according to the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news agency. Exhausted families of hostages are growing impatient with the delay in the ceasefire talks as conflicting reports about the deal have been circulating in the media the past 48 hours. Thousands of Israelis protested again on Tuesday evening, with some demanding from the government that all hostages be released at the same time in a deal with Hamas. Many fear that the hostages who aren’t on the list of the 33 hostages set to be released in the first phase could end up being left behind if the ceasefire collapses before the second stage. This is what happened in the last ceasefire in November, which Hamas broke on the last day of the deal by firing rockets at Israel in the early morning hours. The calm before the storm is also seen by some in Israel as a deliberate attempt by Hamas to cause further psychological terror in the Israeli public. Israel is in a “waiting game”, as one source familiar with the ceasefire talks described it to The Telegraph, with disagreements over the implementation of the deal causing delay. Israeli airstrikes on two homes in central Gaza killed at least 17 Palestinians late on Tuesday and wounded seven more, hospital officials said. In the occupied West Bank, the Health Ministry said at least six people were killed by an Israeli airstrike in the Jenin refugee camp. The Israeli military confirmed a drone strike in the area but gave no further details. In the Gaza Strip, the bodies of 11 people were brought to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital after a strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, officials at the hospital said. Another strike killed six people in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp and wounded seven more, according to Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Among those wounded was Khaled Rayan, the head of the nursing department at the hospital. Over the past 24 hours, the Israeli military said it had struck more than 50 “terrorist” targets across the Gaza Strip. Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv’s “hostages square” on Tuesday night in anticipation of a ceasefire deal, with some singing and playing music on a stage. Some of the country’s best-known musicians performed, including Eviatar Banai, Omer Adam and Aviv Geffen. The aunt of murdered hostage Omer Neutra led the crowd in the prayer “Shema Yisrael” before sending strength to the hostage negotiators. “This is not about politics or strategy. It’s about humanity and the shared belief that no one should be left behind in darkness,” said Moran Stella Yanai, one of the hostages released earlier from Gaza. In Jerusalem, hundreds of Israeli hard-liners marched to voice their opposition to the deal, chanting “you don’t make a deal with the devil,” in reference to the Hamas militant group that attacked Israel on Oct 7, 2023. The call last week from Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy was reportedly blunt and short on diplomatic nicety. Steven Witkoff is said to have told aides to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, that he was headed to Israel on Saturday afternoon. When informed that would be in the middle of the sabbath, but the prime minister could meet in the evening, his reply was apparently “salty” and clear, according to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. The sabbath did not interest Mr Witkoff, the aides were told. Read the full story here. A “tense” meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy led to a breakthrough in the ceasefire-hostage negotiations in Doha, two Arab officials have told The Times of Israel. Steven Witkoff, described by a senior Israeli diplomat as a “businessman who charges ahead unusually aggressively”, reportedly told the Israeli president to accept compromises during a sit down in Jerusalem on Saturday. The Florida property investor then flew on to Doha to take part in the hostage negotiations. One of the main issues that has yet to be finalised is the exact parameters of the IDF’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the Arab officials said. The two officials speculated that a deal would be announced in a joint statement by the US, Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday or Thursday. Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi have vowed to remain in close coordination “over the coming hours”, as negotiators seek to finalise a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. “Both leaders committed to remain in close coordination directly and through their teams over the coming hours,” the White House said in a statement after the leaders’ telephone call.
