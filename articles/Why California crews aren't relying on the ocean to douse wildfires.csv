A major obstacle in the fight has been the low water supplies. While there have been some instances of aerial firefighters scooping water out of the Pacific Ocean––along with retardant, of course––to dump onto the wildfires, it is not heavily used for the most part.

According to Technology.org, the main issue is the corrosion effects on firefighting equipment from the salt content in the ocean water. Water tanks and other pieces of firefighter equipment have numerous parts that are made from metal, which will corrode from salt water. La Jolla, Calif. (Art Wager/Getty Images:1908609423-170667a) The BC Wildfire Service will use salt water if necessary, but due to its potential corrosiveness on firefighting equipment, it will always opt for fresh water, the B.C. ministry added. ""Since the province does not regularly use salt water to fight wildfires in B.C., data on its impact to the landscape or its effectiveness is limited,"" said the forestry ministry. When comparing the two types of water, fresh does a better job at putting out wildfires, mainly because of the properties it contains. Salt can reduce the cooling effect of water, reducing its efficiency at lowering the temperature of the fire. And the source of the extinguishment can differ, depending on the type of fire. Certain, specialized fires may require specialty extinguishing agents, such as foam or dry chemicals.

Many wildfires burn far away from the coast, often in remote areas. Transporting ocean water to those locations would be cumbersome and complex at a time when speed is crucial. As well, there is the issue of electrical conductivity. Salt water is a suitable conductor of electricity. Using it on electrical fires can be hazardous since it could elevate the risk of electrical shock. “There is one other reason not to use salt water to fight fires, and that is that salt water is highly conductive,"" said Ze’ev Gedalof, associate professor at the University of Guelph, in a recent interview with The Weather Network. (BC Wildfire Service) “If you've got live power lines and salt water together, that's dangerous for the people who are fighting the fire. There is a real risk of shock.” The environmental impacts have been documents. Similar to road salt runoff, ocean water could also seep into rivers and streams. All of that may then impact wildlife. To simulate the impacts of salt and fresh water on coastal forests, scientists used a freshwater woodland at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) as part of a project to unravel the future effects of sudden deluges.

Salty water from Chesapeake Bay was inserted into tanks and splashed on the forest soil surface, quick enough to saturate the soil. After 30 hours of exposure to the salt water in June 2004, scientists started to notice changes in the forest. ""The leaves of tulip poplar in the forests started to brown in mid-August, several weeks earlier than normal. By mid-September, the forest canopy was bare, as if winter had set in. These changes did not occur in a nearby plot that we treated the same way, but with fresh water rather than sea water,"" said Patrick Megonigal, ecosystem ecologist and associate director of research at SERC, in an article he wrote for The Conversation, published on Jan. 13, 2025.

According to Megonigal, sea level rise has increased by an average of about eight inches (203 millimetres) globally over the past century. The result has seen salty water being pushed into U.S. forests, farms and neighbourhoods that had previously had only been exposed to fresh water. ""As the rate of sea level rise accelerates, storms push sea water ever farther onto the dry land, eventually killing trees and creating ghost forests, a result of climate change that is widespread in the U.S. and globally,"" Megonigal wrote in the Jan. 13 article.
