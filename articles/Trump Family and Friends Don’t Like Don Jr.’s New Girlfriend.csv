Sources told Mediaite that the president-elect and his advisers worry Anderson’s partying ways could hurt Don Jr. “Individuals close to the president have expressed growing concerns about the potential liability posed by his son’s new relationship,” a Trump family friend told Mediaite on Monday. The family friend added, “I told him that she’s not someone he should be around, and let him know about her past.” Don Jr. was allegedly warned that Anderson has a history of parading around with wealthy men in Palm Beach, but Anderson’s camp has denied such claims, according to Mediaite. “Donald Trump does not approve of his son’s association with Bettina,” another “close family friend” claimed. “Bettina’s presence is seen as a liability rather than an asset.” Anderson was seated behind Don Jr. and Guilfoyle, among other Trump family members, at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The comments from family sources seem to be a far cry from what the president-elect has openly said about Guilfoyle, who actively worked publicly and privately as MAGA’s mouthpiece in fundraising. Now that Guilfoyle has been booted from Don Jr.’s orbit with a plush ambassadorship post in Greece, pending Senate confirmation, sources close to the Trump family clan are hinting at some buyer’s remorse. If Don Jr. brings Anderson as his date to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, it could permanently tie her to the first family in the public’s eye. “The idea that he might have the audacity to bring a casual partner on stage at the inauguration has been described as a potential misstep that could etch this relationship, and its questionable nature, into the history books,” said the family friend."
