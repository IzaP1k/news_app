Though the cathedral wasn't completed in time for the athletic competitions, it still opened its doors in December 2024, meeting an ambitious deadline. At the centre of the effort was a cutting-edge software donated by U.S. tech company Autodesk, which the reconstruction team used to digitally map the Notre-Dame, and carefully plan each step of the rebuilding process."
