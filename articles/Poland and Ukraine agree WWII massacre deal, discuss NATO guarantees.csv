The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the need for Polish families to bury their relatives with dignity. It had become a sticking point between the two neighbours amid Warsaw's support for Kiev in its now three-year war with Russia. During massacres in what is now western Ukraine between 1943 and 1945, Ukrainian nationalists murdered around 100,000 Poles. They aimed to reinforce claims to the territory through an uprising against the German Nazi occupiers and the elimination of the Polish population. Estimates suggest up to 20,000 Ukrainians were killed in retaliatory actions. Tusk told a news conference: ""We will solve the problem of commemorating the victims of the Volhynia massacres. I do not want anyone in Poland or Europe to make this a political condition for supporting Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia."" Zelensky added: ""Poland's support is very important to us. We must move forward in our relations, look ahead."" Zelensky also used the news conference to reiterate his support for the deployment of NATO troops as part of security guarantees following any peace agreement with Russia. ""We support the idea that a contingent from one country or another, our allies, our strategic partners, can become part of the security guarantees,"" he said. Zelensky has discussed the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron and the Baltic States. He will also talk with Britain, he added. The strength and location of any deployment is still to be clarified, with a ceasefire in Ukraine not yet on the horizon."
