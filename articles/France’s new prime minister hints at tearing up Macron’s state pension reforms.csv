In 2023, Macron pushed through legislation that raised the legal age of retirement from 62 to 64 by 2030 in order to help plug France’s ballooning deficit – despite bitter resistance from political opponents, unions and the French public. However, François Bayrou, France’s prime minister, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the reforms would be “renegotiated” in a bid to win over Left-wing lawmakers he needs to pass the 2025 budget in a hung parliament. Mr Bayrou, a close Macron ally, was appointed a month ago after Michel Barnier, the previous prime minister, was ousted in a no-confidence vote. The most contested part of the reform – being the minimum age of 64 to draw a full pension – should not be “a taboo” in the review over the coming months, Mr Bayrou said. But he warned that France’s growing debt pile was a “sword of Damocles” hanging over future generations’ heads, and that any new deal will have to be financially balanced. If it can’t be balanced, the current deal would remain in place, he added. Some centre-Right MPs, alarmed by France’s deteriorating public finances, cheered Mr Bayrou’s decision to rule out a repeal or suspension of the pension reform demanded by the Socialist Party (PS) and its allies. Mr Macron’s ambitious, and deeply unpopular flagship policy, has helped undermine his position as president. In parliamentary elections this summer, a majority of voters backed parties opposed to the president’s reforms. France Unbowed, the largest party in the Left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, wants to reduce the state pension age from 62 to 60. Marine Le Pen’s far-Right National Rally party has also floated the idea. Under Mr Macron’s reforms, France’s legal age of retirement will gradually rise from 62 to 64 by 2030. Citizens will need to work for 43 years – up from 42 – to receive a full state pension, which averages around €1,500 (£1,265) a month. By contrast, Britain’s state pension age is set to rise from 66 to 67 by 2026. Protests erupted across France in 2023 as millions of workers demanded the policy be reversed – as well as an improvement to economic conditions more generally. However, analysts believe that in order to balance the books, the government will need to take an axe to France’s generous pension system – which accounts for over a quarter of public spending. France has one of the lowest retirement ages in Europe and one of the highest state pension entitlements relative to the cost of living. The French state pension is based on a final salary calculation. On average, pensioners receive around 74pc of their pre-retirement earnings, according to research from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The figure stands in stark contrast to just 58pc for British retirees, and an average of 68pc across the European Union. Mr Bayrou’s new government is under mounting pressure to make €60bn in tax hikes and spending cuts to tackle France’s fiscal black hole. France is currently operating under an emergency budget law to avoid the shutdown of the government. Mr Macron’s decision to call snap legislative elections in June has thrown the National Assembly into turmoil after his centrists lost the poll, strengthening the far-Right and a Leftist alliance. Mr Bayrou said on Tuesday: “No one denies that there is a huge problem with financing our pension system. At the same time, many people who have participated in these discussions have agreed that we will be able to reach the same result with a more just reform. “So I propose to go back to take a fresh look at the pension reform using a radical approach, based on figures that are beyond debate. “We will set up a fast-track mission in the following weeks to take stock of the present situation to see where we stand exactly. “The law of 2023 provided for the age for retiring moved to 63 by 2026. But I’m convinced that we will be able to find a new type of reform without any taboos and nothing that is off-limits, even the issue of the age of retirement. “What is imperative is not to turn our back on the fiscal unbalance of this debt.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
