The office of new Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said he met the French ambassador to Beirut on Tuesday to discuss preparations for Macron's visit. The French presidency confirmed the date. The trip follows Lebanon's breakthrough election of Aoun as president on Thursday, ending a two-year vacancy amid pressure from international powers including France, the country's former colonial ruler. On Monday, Aoun appointed Nawaf Salam, an international judge and diplomat, as prime minister. Salam now faces the challenge of forming a government to address Lebanon's severe economic crisis, which has stretched over five years. US and France lead backing for Lebanon-Israel ceasefire deal ""The unwavering commitment of France to support Lebanon, its sovereignty and unity"" would be highlighted during the visit, said Macron's office. His trip follows a ceasefire in November between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which was announced by Macron and US President Joe Biden. Macron said on Monday that Salam's appointment represented ""hope for change"" in Lebanon.
