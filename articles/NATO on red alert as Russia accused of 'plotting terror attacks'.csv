Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Russia has been committing ""acts of air terror"" against airlines as part of global sabotage schemes. He said: ""The latest information can confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of terrorism in the air not only against Poland."" Moscow has previously denied claims of sabotage and called accusations unfounded, but Western officials believe there is a plot to plant explosive devices in cargo planes heading to America."
