Kiev has received 25 prisoners of war and civilians aged between 24 and 60, the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday. Soldiers from the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya and Donetsk regions as well as wounded soldiers from the contested Russian border area of Kursk are among those released. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the exchange. The goal remains to bring all prisoners home, Zelensky said on X. Many of the returnees had serious injuries and illnesses and were now receiving medical care. The Russian Ministry of Defence had previously provided information about the exchange, but only mentioned 25 prisoners of war coming home and not civilians. According to the statement, the exchange took place on the border with Belarus. Ukraine has been resisting the Russian invasion for almost three years."
