President-elect Trump's top aide on immigration and the border spoke with House Republicans during a roughly hour-long meeting Wednesday. Lawmakers who left the room hailed Stephen Miller, who was tapped to be U.S. Homeland Security adviser in the new Trump administration, as a brilliant policy mind. Two sources present for the discussions told Fox News Digital Miller talked about the need to scale up the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) workforce, which is noteworthy given Trump's promise to execute mass deportations when he returns to office. Miller also discussed ways to cut federal funds going toward sanctuary cities and states, a cash flow that Republicans had previously promised to target if they were to control the levers of power in Washington.

(Getty Images) The strategy meeting comes as congressional Republicans are preparing for a massive conservative policy overhaul through the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the threshold for passage in the Senate from 60 votes to 51, reconciliation allows the party controlling Congress and the White House to pass broad policy changes — provided they deal with budgetary and other fiscal matters. The sources told Fox News Digital Miller's portion of the meeting partly focused on what border and immigration policies could go into a reconciliation package and what kind of funding Congress would need to appropriate.  1.4 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN US HAVE BEEN ORDERED DEPORTED, BUT HAVE YET TO BE REMOVED: OFFICIAL The sources said Miller told Republicans the incoming Trump administration understood the president-elect's border and immigration goals were ""probably not going to get a lot"" of Democratic votes and that ""those more controversial things would need to be in reconciliation."" More bipartisan initiatives could be passed during the regular process, the sources added.  A House GOP lawmaker told Fox News Digital of an understanding that Congress would follow Trump's lead. ""I think we're going to see a slew of executive orders early, and that is going to be helpful to separate from what we have to do legislatively,"" the lawmaker said. One source in the room said Miller emphasized the importance of messaging, adding that ""nothing matters if we don't get our message out to the American people."" President-elect Trump has promised to carry out mass deportations. (Donald Trump/Truth Social) Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital Miller discussed ""low-hanging fruit"" that Trump could tackle by executive order, mentioning ""deportation"" as a possibility. ""Tax stuff, that's going to take some time,"" Norman said. Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., declined to go into specifics about the meeting but told Fox News Digital the discussion focused on ""illegal immigration and how that's going to be curbed … to bring commonsense solutions to the program."" HOUSE DOGE CAUCUS EYES FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN NEW GOAL-SETTING MEMO ""I had a couple of questions about the cost to American taxpayers if we don't repatriate some 12 million illegal aliens who the Biden administration has let into our country,"" Alford said. Miller declined to answer reporters' questions when he left the room. He was invited to address the Republican Study Committee led by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the House GOP's largest caucus, which acts as a conservative think tank of sorts for the rest of the House Republican Conference.  Pfluger told Fox News Digital in a statement after the meeting, ""The Republican Study Committee is in lockstep with the incoming Trump administration. We are committed to working around the clock to deliver on the promises we made to the American people, especially when it comes to securing our border and enforcing immigration policies."" ""We will continue to work with Stephen Miller and his team to deliver the legislative victories they need from the House."" House GOP leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were not in attendance, nor were they expected. Rep. Mark Alford said he asked about the cost to taxpayers to keep millions of illegal immigrants in the country. (Getty Images) Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., the group's previous chairman, said there was ""nothing new"" said during the meeting, adding it was an opportunity for Trump's aides to address the House GOP.
