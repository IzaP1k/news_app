      "['Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees for key roles in the intelligence, foreign policy and law enforcement agencies all pledged to keep politics out of their offices amid concerns from Democrats that the president-elect will carry out his vows to go after his political enemies once in office.', 'Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, repeatedly insisted she would not allow politics to infect her Justice Department – accusing President Joe Biden’s DOJ of being responsible for politicizing law enforcement against Trump.', '“Every case will be prosecuted based on the facts and the law that’s applied in good faith, period. Politics have got to be taken out of the system,” Bondi said before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “This department has been weaponized for years and years and years, and it has to stop.”', 'In addition to Bondi’s pledge not to be influenced by politics, Trump’s nominee for CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said he would not impose “political litmus tests” at the agency, while secretary of state nominee and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, defended the importance of NATO, an alliance Trump has often questioned.', 'The confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks kicked off Tuesday with a highly contentious session for defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth. On Wednesday, the slate of a half-dozen hearings struck a much more conciliatory tone, where the concerns raised by senators were about the conduct of the president-elect and not the nominees themselves.', 'There were still heated moments Wednesday, particularly with Bondi and questions about claims of 2020 election fraud and Trump’s calls for jailing his enemies including special counsel Jack Smith and former Rep. Liz Cheney. “I’m not going to be bullied by you,” Bondi declared during a testify back-and-forth with Sen. Alex Padilla of California.', 'But Democratic senators made clear they were not going to blanketly oppose all of Trump’s nominees, particularly Rubio, a fellow senator. On Wednesday, Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado introduced Trump’s energy secretary nominee, fracking CEO Chris Wright, who is also from Colorado.', 'There are still more contentious hearings looming, including Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; his pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and for FBI director, Kash Patel – who was invoked by Democrats multiple times during Bondi’s hearing.', 'Here are the takeaways from Wednesday’s slate of confirmation hearings:', 'Democrats repeatedly pressed Bondi on Wednesday about her ability to stand up to Trump, who has said he has an “absolute right” to be involved in Justice Department matters and clashed with his attorneys general in his first administration when they did not bend to his wishes.', '“I need to know that you would tell the president ‘no’ if you are asked to do something that is wrong, illegal or unconstitutional,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat.', 'Bondi responded by blasting the “weaponization” of the Biden Justice Department and said that she would not improperly target people with criminal probes like those against Trump.', '“I will not politicize that office,” Bondi said of being attorney general. “I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation.”', 'Bondi also vowed Wednesday to follow the Justice Department’s policy to limit contacts between the White House and the Justice Department.', '“I believe this Justice Department must be independent and must act independently,” she said.', 'Pressed on whether she would investigate officials Trump has suggested should be jailed – including special counsel Jack Smith and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney – Bondi said “no one would be pre-judged.”', 'Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii questioned Bondi over comments she made during the 2024 election cycle that “bad” prosecutors should be held criminally responsible.', '“Sometimes ‘bad’ is in the eye of the beholder. I am just asking whether you would consider Jack Smith to be one of the people,” Hirono said. “How about Liz Cheney? How about Merrick Garland?”', '“Senator, I am not going into hypotheticals,” Bondi responded. “No one has been pre-judged, nor will anyone be pre-judged if I am confirmed.”', 'Later, Bondi clashed with Sen. Adam Schiff of California – another of Trump’s longtime targets – over whether her personal political beliefs would affect decisions on January 6 pardons and the preservation of evidence from the special counsel investigations into Trump.', 'At one point in the exchange, Bondi raised the House’s Republican-led censure of Schiff in 2023, while he pressed her on whether there was evidence to start an investigation into Smith.', '“It would be irresponsible of me to make a commitment regarding anything,” Bondi said. “What I’m hearing on the news is horrible. Do I know if he committed a crime? I have not looked at it.”', 'Bondi was questioned about whether she accepts that Biden won the 2020 election – a fact that Trump continues to falsely dispute after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results.', 'Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday she accepts that Trump lost the 2020 election but falsely claimed “there was a peaceful transition of power” that year, ignoring the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that disrupted the election certification.', '“President Biden is the president of the United States,” Bondi said. “He was duly sworn in, and he is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024.”', 'She also sowed doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 results, citing her on-the-ground legal work that year for the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania. Trump has falsely claimed there was massive fraud in the state, and dispatched Bondi and other allies like Rudy Giuliani to try to overturn the results there.', '“I accept the results. I accept, of course, that Joe Biden is President of the United States,” she said. “But what I can tell you is what I saw firsthand when I went to Pennsylvania as an advocate for the (2020) campaign… I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened? I saw so much.”', 'Bondi was also questioned about pardons for those convicted of crimes related to January 6, as Trump has suggested he will do in some cases once in office.', 'Asked whether she believes “violent assaults on police officers should be pardoned,” Bondi said that she would advise the president as her job requires.', '“The pardons, of course, fall under the president,” Bondi said. “But if asked to look at those cases, I will look at each case and advise on a case-by-case basis, just as I did my entire career as a prosecutor.”', 'Several Democrats asked Bondi to respond to comments that Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has made about prosecuting the president-elect’s enemies. Bondi defended Patel’s credentials, while suggesting at several points that senators should pose their questions to him when he testified before the panel.', 'Still, Bondi was clear when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island pressed her on Patel’s comments about going after the president’s enemies. “There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,” Bondi said.', 'Rubio, who has served as a senator for more than a decade, may have received the warmest reception from his colleagues when he appeared on the other side of the dais Wednesday as Trump’s nominee to lead the State Department.', 'New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Rubio “has the skills” and is “well-qualified to serve as secretary of state.”', '“I believe this committee has a responsibility to get your team out to the field and we hope you will send us qualified, experienced, and well-vetted nominees to consider,” she said, noting the need to confirm career diplomats.', 'During questions from senators, Rubio voiced his support for NATO – as well as the bipartisan law he co-sponsored, which states that the US cannot withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval or an act of Congress.', '“I was a co-sponsor of the law, and so it’s tough to say I’m not in support of a law that I helped to pass and that I think it’s an important role for Congress to play,” Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.', 'In response to questions about Russia’s war against Ukraine, Rubio said it’s “unrealistic to believe” Ukraine can push Russian forces back to where they were before the 2022 invasion and that the official US position should be that the war should end.', 'Rubio added he and Trump agree about the war needing to come to an end and criticized the Biden administration for not setting a clear “end goal” for the war.', '“What Vladimir Putin has done is unacceptable, there’s no doubt about it, but this war has to end, and I think it should be the official policy of the United States that we want to see it end,” Rubio said.', 'While Rubio was testifying, the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced, which committee chairman Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho announced to the hearing room.', 'Rubio credited both the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff for the agreement. “I dare to say that all involved deserve credit for the ceasefire that the chairman has just announced,” Rubio told senators.', '“Before we all celebrate, though, obviously, we’re all going to want to see how that executes,” Risch cautioned.', 'Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe pledged not to politicize his work and the intelligence that’s produced in the Trump administration. He told the committee he would never allow “political or personal biases to cloud our judgement or infect our products.”', 'Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, urged Ratcliffe to reassure rank-and-file intelligence officials that they “need not fear reprisal for speaking truth to power.”', 'The Virginia Democrat expressed concerns about the attacks that some Trump loyalists have made against the intelligence community, asking Ratcliffe to commit not to fire or force out CIA employees because of their political views.', '“If you are asked to remove personnel, to get rid of individuals based upon this kind of political litmus test, I’d ask that you keep the committee informed of those, those requests,” Warner said to Ratcliffe.', '“I certainly will,” Ratcliffe said.', '“I think my record in terms of speaking truth to power and defending the intelligence community and its good work is very clear,” Ratcliffe added.', 'Across the Capitol complex, several additional Trump Cabinet picks testified ahead of the president-elect’s inauguration next week.', 'During tense questioning on climate change by a California senator, Trump energy pick Chris Wright said he stood by past social media comments that “the hype over wildfires is just hype” to justify climate policies he views as detrimental.', 'Padilla, whose state is currently battling massive wildfires in Los Angeles, asked Wright if he stood by those comments in light of the current deadly and devastating fires.', '“I stand by my past comments,” Wright said.', '“Tell that to the families of the more than two-dozen people” who lost their lives, Padilla shot back.', 'Wright later said the fires were “horrific.”', 'Wright, a fracking CEO in Colorado, vowed in his testimony to “unleash American energy” – echoing a talking point Trump often repeated on the campaign trail.

      "[\"Jan. 15 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, vowed to remain independent and nonpartisan during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.\", 'Bondi did not distance herself from disproven claims about the 2020 election or rebuke the rhetoric of some of her fellow Cabinet nominees, however. Instead, she talked around some questions on those subjects while embracing the notion that the Department of Justice has been politically weaponized.', 'The differing interests of Republicans and Democrats were on display throughout the hearing. Republicans remained concerned about the alleged political weaponization and lost trust in the Department of Justice under the Biden administration.', 'Democrats were particularly interested in Bondi\\'s ability to say \"no\" to Trump if asked to do something illegal or unconstitutional. Bondi reiterated that she will be the ultimate decision maker that will dictate the Justice Department\\'s actions.', \"Democrats remained skeptical about Bondi's close relationship to Trump. She has served as a legal adviser to the president-elect, campaigned on his behalf and advocated for him as he challenged the results of the 2020 election.\", 'Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it \"ridiculous\" that Bondi\\'s relationship with Trump is of any concern, adding that President John. F. Kennedy chose his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, as his attorney general.', '\"This idea there\\'s something bad is ridiculous,\" Graham said. \"Who do you pick? You pick people you know. You pick people you trust and pick people who are qualified. The idea that there\\'s something wrong with that is absolutely ridiculous.\"', 'While Bondi\\'s qualifications and character were the focal point of the hearing, the character of another nominee, Kash Patel, was brought into question, as well. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Bondi if she would adopt Patel\\'s \"enemies list\" that he has discussed at length across multiple public statements. Bondi supported Patel\\'s nomination for FBI director but pushed back on the existence of an enemies list.', '\"I don\\'t believe he has an enemies list. He made a quote on TV which I have not heard,\" Bondi responded. \"He has great experience in the intel department. I believe that Kash is the right person at this time for this job.\"', '\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" she added.', \"If both are confirmed, Patel would be under Bondi's purview.\", 'Some of Bondi\\'s responses have been repeated throughout the hearing. When asked to weigh in on comments by Trump or Patel, she has deflected by saying she is \"not familiar\" with those statements. When asked who won the 2020 election, she has responded \"Joe Biden is the president.\"', 'Republicans have focused on the alleged political weaponization of the Department of Justice under the Biden administration. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, exclaimed that he does not want a Republican or Democratic Department of Justice.', '\"I want a Department of Justice that follows the damn law,\" Cruz said as he pounded his desk.', \"Cruz is one of several Republican senators who have expressed their belief that the Biden administration's Justice Department has targeted political opponents, namely Trump.\", \"During his opening statement, committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, lauded Bondi for her experience and her work combatting the opioid epidemic and human trafficking while she was Florida's attorney general. He and the lawmakers who introduced Bondi -- Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. -- meanwhile called on Bondi to restore trust in the Justice Department, citing weaponization under the Biden administration.\", '\"The Justice Department is infected with political decision-making while its leaders refuse to recognize that reality,\" Grassley said. \"I know, as other people on this committee and in and out of Congress know, what government weaponization is.\"', 'Bondi echoed the criticisms of the current Justice Department.', '\"I will fight everyday to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Partisanship will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"', 'Bondi, a private practice lawyer, was the attorney general of Florida from 2011 to 2019. She has also served as an adviser to Trump during his first impeachment trial in 2019.', \"Bondi has also parroted Trump's false claims that the 2020 election results were fraudulent. Ranking Democrat Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois asked Bondi if she accepts that President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory was legitimate. She said she accepts the result but raised questions about election integrity. She did not provide a straight answer.\", \"She did take the opportunity, while responding on multiple occasions, to highlight Trump's 2024 victory.\", 'Bondi went on to say she did not listen to the audio recording of Trump\\'s phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. During this call, Trump asked Raffensperger to \"find\" the votes he needed to overturn the results of the election. Bondi claimed this is not what Trump was asking, despite saying she has not listened to the call in full.', 'Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., encouraged Bondi to listen to the recording.', \"Bondi did not directly say whether or not she would support Trump's plan to pardon the Capitol rioters who have been charged or convicted for participating in the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\", '\"I have not seen any of those files,\" she said. \"If confirmed and asked to advise, I will look at each file. I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"', 'Several Republican senators indicated that they do not believe she or Trump would pardon violent offenders from the Capitol riot.', \"The hearing became tense during Bondi's exchanges with Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, both of California. Both asked her to answer whether she had evidence of mass fraud in the 2020 election or if she would walk back statements that Trump won Pennsylvania in that election. She did not answer either question.\", '\"You cut me off when I was speaking,\" Bondi said during a back-and-forth with Padilla. \"I\\'m not going to be bullied by you, Sen. Padilla.\"', 'Padilla would go on to ask Bondi if she recognized the 14th Amendment, referring to birthright citizenship, as the law of the land. Their exchange was again marked with crosstalk between the two, culminating in Bondi saying \"I\\'m not here to do your homework and study for you.\"', '\"You\\'re asking to serve as the attorney general of the United States and you still need to study the 14th Amendment of the Constitution?\" Padilla said. \"That is not helping me have more confidence in your ability to do this job.\"', 'Trump originally meant to nominate former congressman Matt Gaetz but he withdrew his nomination in the face of allegations of sexual misconduct, including a sexual relationship with a minor.', 'The committee convened at 9:30 a.m. EST. It concluded after nearly six hours, including a lunch break.', \"Bondi's is one of several confirmation hearings held Wednesday. Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations committee beginning at 10 a.m.\", 'South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was also scheduled for a confirmation hearing as she vies to be the director of homeland security. Her hearing was rescheduled for Friday.', \"On Tuesday, Trump's secretary of defense choice, Pete Hegseth, faced the Senate Armed Forces Committee. Hegseth was grilled for sexist comments he has made, accusations of sexual assault and alcohol abuse.\"] \n",

Under the first stage, which will take place over the course of six weeks, Israeli forces are to withdraw from populated areas in Gaza and be stationed along the border, allowing for a hostage swap and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes. Hamas will release 33 hostages, including all women, children and elderly people in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, Al Thani said. Increased humanitarian aid and basic supplies will also be allowed to enter the Strip during this phase.', 'Negotiations over the second and third phases of the deal will take place during the six weeks scheduled for the first, according to Al Thani.', 'The agreement is scheduled to take effect on Sunday, Al Thani said, stressing the delicate period between the announcement of the deal and its implementation.

The inking of a ceasefire deal brings to a halt more than a year of war in Gaza, during which the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 wounded.', 'The three-phase deal will begin with “a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded” over a period of six weeks, Biden explained. The second phase, which is still being negotiated, would see a “permanent end to the war,” he added.', 'Biden said the deal would end “more than 15 months of conflict” that began with the “brutal assault” on Israel, as well as “more than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families and the Israeli people,” and “more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza.” He added that he and Vice President Kamala Harris “cannot wait” to welcome American hostages home.', 'He stressed that the ceasefire would continue past the six-week period if the negotiations take longer. The second phase of the deal would involve releasing “all remaining living hostages,” and a withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. At that point, the ceasefire would become permanent, Biden said. He added that a third phase would consist of the return of the remains of any deceased hostages, plus the start of a “major reconstruction plan” for Gaza.', 'Biden also made a point of noting in his Wednesday speech that the ceasefire agreement is one he “introduced” last spring, but said his team has been working closely with the incoming Trump administration in the final days of the deal negotiations.', '“In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” he said.', 'For his part, Trump attempted to take sole credit for the agreement in a post to his Truth Social platform, writing that the “EPIC” agreement “could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.”', '“With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven,” he added.', 'Asked about Trump’s boasts and claims to be responsible for the deal, Biden grinned and pointed out that the agreement largely follows the framework he proposed last May.', 'He credited American support for Israel with having helped to “badly weaken Hamas and its’ backers and create the conditions for this deal,” and stressed that he’d known all along that the deal would have to be implemented by Trump and his team.', '“So I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we’re all speaking with the same voice,” he said. “Because that’s what American presidents do.”', 'In a separate statement, the president said the agreement had been the product of “intense diplomacy.” The agreement — which Biden called a result of both “the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran” along with “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy” — tracks the details first laid out in a United Nations Security Council-endorsed plan put forth by the United States last year.', 'On Monday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that efforts to close the deal were ongoing and had “accelerated” in recent weeks, with McGurk, a veteran diplomat and foreign policy expert who has served in multiple administrations, having “camped out” in Doha while “working to tighten up these details and try to get this done.”', 'Sullivan said Biden’s team had “coordinated very closely” with the incoming Trump team to “present a united message to all the parties, which says it is in the American national security interest — regardless of party, regardless of outgoing or incoming administration” and “get this deal done as fast as possible.”', 'The way the talks had run up against an American presidential transition had brought to mind the chaotic scenario faced by Ronald Reagan when he succeeded Jimmy Carter after defeating him in the 1980 election amid the Iran hostage crisis.', 'At the time and in the years since, it has been argued by some historians that the Reagan team back-channeled with Iran to keep the hostages captive until Reagan took office — as they were in fact released just minutes after he was sworn in.', 'Asked whether he or Biden were concerned that the negotiations were being hampered by American political considerations, Sullivan said he doubted the thought had even crossed Biden’s mind.', '“What was on his mind is we’re in this period of change and transition, and we can’t have anything missed between the cup and the lip in the handoff between our administration and the incoming administration. So, he told us, he told me, ‘Sit down with your successor as soon as you possibly can and start working through and mapping out what they need to know and how we can work together in this period of transition to put ourselves in the best position possible,’” he said.', '“These are not partisan issues; these are American national security issues. And it’s the kind of spirit that President Biden has brought to this job from the very beginning that set the politics aside, do what’s right for the country, and have our team work with the incoming team in that regard,” Sullivan continued, adding that the engagement between the Biden and Trump teams had been “professional” as well as “deep and substantive.”'] \n",

      "['After months of deadlock and more than 15 months of war, Israel and the militant group Hamas reached a fresh Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.', 'The deal includes a six-week initial ceasefire phase and the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, Biden said.', 'Biden said that Americans would be part of the initial release. He did not say how many. Seven Americans are being held hostage by Hamas. Four have been confirmed dead. Three are believed to be alive: Edan Alexander, 21, Keith Siegel, 64, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36.', '\"The road to this deal has not been easy. I\\'ve worked in foreign policy for decades, this is one of the toughest negotiations that I\\'ve ever experienced,\" Biden said from the White House. \"I\\'ve reached this point because ... of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States.\"', 'The agreement, which is expected to unfold in three phases and take effect in two or three days, was mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The truce is intended to halt fighting that has devastated Gaza and destabilized the Middle East. It comes just days before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as 47th president of the United States.', 'The deal also comes after several waves of negotiations stalled and failed to reach a sequel to an agreement reached in November 2023 during which 105 hostages were released in a weeklong truce. As part of that agreement, 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel were freed before fighting resumed.', 'The first phase of the deal was expected to see 33 civilians and female soldiers held hostage in Gaza released in the first 42 days. In return, Israel will free as many as 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails and its troops will withdraw from city centers in Gaza, a key coastal road and a strategic strip of land along the border with Egypt.', 'Biden said the exact details would be forthcoming.', \"Negotiations to reach the second phase, when the remaining hostages would be released, would likely begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. In the second phase, more Israeli troops would also pull out of the Palestinian territory and the temporary ceasefire would become permanent. Biden said the second phase, if it's reached, would mark a permanent to the end of the war. Phase three would involve the transfer of the remains of deceased hostages to their families and the reconstruction of Gaza.\", 'If initial negotiations take more than six weeks, they will continue, Biden said, for as long as a resolution to the conflict takes.', '\"There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. And I\\'m deeply satisfied this day has finally come for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza, who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war,\" Biden said.', \"Hamas kidnapped 251 people and killed more than 1,200 on Oct. 7, 2023, when it attacked communities in southern Israel, triggering a massive military response from Israel. Israel's government believes 94 hostages are still in Gaza, 60 of whom are assumed to be alive. Four of the hostages were taken in earlier incidents.\", \"Their 20-year-old is a hostage in Gaza: Here's what they know about her condition.\", \"More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operation, according to figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million population has been displaced.\", 'The war in Gaza has upended the entire Middle East region, mushrooming into Israeli conflicts with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Iran-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran itself. The war also appeared to create conditions that led to the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad.', \"Trapped in Gaza for a year: Here's her harrowing story\", 'Trump and Biden have been vying to claim credit for the agreement before Jan. 20, when Trump takes office. Trump said last month that he wanted a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to be reached before he takes office. Otherwise, he said, there will be \"all hell to pay.\"', 'Trump was quick to comment on the agreement reached Wednesday, claiming his election victory was responsible for the deal coming together. \"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,\" Trump said in a social media post.', \"Biden said his administration was responsible for the terms of the agreement but he told his team to coordinate closely with Trump's advisers to make sure the U.S. was speaking with one voice.\", '\"I\\'d also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration. These past few days, we\\'ve been speaking as one team,\" Biden said.', 'This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Israel and Hamas agree on Gaza ceasefire, hostage release deal'] \n",

However, multiple well-placed UK government sources have stressed Sir Keir is not yet fully signed up.', 'One Whitehall source told The Telegraph: “There are challenges over what we could support, what would we want to support, and the broader question about the threat that those troops may be under and whether that is escalatory.”', 'The proposal comes as European leaders scramble to work out how to continue supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty as president-elect Donald Trump pushes for Kyiv to strike a peace deal with Russia.', 'Mr Trump enters the White House on Monday.

One Government source told The Telegraph: “We are getting slightly ahead of ourselves. We are not there yet.”', 'However, that the discussions are happening shows the degree to which Downing Street is determined to keep supporting Ukraine, even after Mr Trump takes office.', 'Any commitment of troops, should it happen, would put significant new pressure on the Ministry of Defence’s budget at a time when the Treasury is looking for spending cuts.', 'In the spring Sir Keir will unveil his timeline for increasing UK defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product a year, up from around 2.3 per cent, but it remains unclear if the level can be reached before 2030.', 'A deployment could involve thousands of British troops at a time when military leaders have already warned that the UK does not have the capacity to fight a war.', 'It would also risk being seen as an escalation by Russia – a framing Downing Street has always rejected. Successive prime ministers have resisted announcing that British soldiers will be deployed in Ukraine ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.', 'Ukraine is not part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), which has a rule that an attack on one member is an attack on all, though the UK wants it to join one day.', 'Questions about whether a no-fly zone would be established over the new Ukrainian land mass, and how it could be enforced, would also be sure to be raised.', 'Boris Johnson, the former Tory prime minister, has expressed interest in the West putting boots on the ground in Ukraine as a peacekeeping force.', 'Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory foreign secretary, and two former defence secretaries – Grant Shapps and Sir Gavin Williamson – have also publicly backed the idea.', 'A UK Government spokesman said: “The UK is taking a leading role in supporting Ukraine, which is why the Prime Minister committed £3 billion a year of military support for Ukraine for as long as it takes, and this year the UK will spend more than it ever has on military funding for Ukraine.', '“Our focus remains on bolstering Ukraine’s defence, and we continue to push international partners to ramp up their financial support to Ukraine to ensure Putin loses.', '“The Prime Minister has also made a clear commitment to speak regularly with President Zelensky, and have met in person six times, including hosting him at No 10 twice.”', 'A spokesman for the Elysee Palace declined to comment.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
