Name: Link, dtype: object","US President Joe Biden announced Wednesday a ""full and complete"" ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the first part of their peace accord, and said he had acted as ""one team"" with incoming leader Donald Trump. Speaking at the White House just days before he leaves office, a visibly relieved Biden said the negotiations to halt the Gaza conflict had been some of the ""toughest"" of his career. ""I'm deeply satisfied this day has come, finally come,"" Biden said in a televised statement. A number of Americans would be among the hostages who would be released by Palestinian militants in Gaza, he added. The first phase of the deal would last six weeks and include a ""full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas,"" Biden said. The as yet unfinalized second phase would bring a ""permanent end to the war,"" the 82-year-old Democrat said, adding he was ""confident"" the deal would hold. Biden's administration has been criticized for its channeling of military aid to Israel during its offensive in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas's deadly October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. But he said pressure on Hamas and its Iranian backers had helped push through a truce, adding that the deal now agreed was the ""exact"" same as one he had proposed in May. Biden, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meanwhile said his administration had been working as ""one team"" with Trump's ahead of the Republican starting his second term as president on January 20. ""In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team,"" said Biden, noting that most of the implementation of the deal would be under a Trump White House. ""I told my team to coordinate close with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice -- because that's what American presidents do."" Trump earlier claimed credit for the ""epic"" deal, in posts on social media. His Mideast envoy was involved in the talks and consulted with the White House. Asked by a reporter whether he or Trump was mainly responsible for the deal, Biden replied: ""Is that a joke?"" aue-dk/mlm"
2,Biden pointedly notes that he ‘introduced’ Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal after...,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-israel-h...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Hamas and Israel have reached a ceasefire deal brokered by the United States with the aid of the Egyptian and Qatari governments, ending 15 months of violence that began with the October 7, 2023, terror attacks, President Joe Biden announced Wednesday afternoon. Speaking from the White House not long after news of the agreement became public, Biden said it was “a very good afternoon” because he could announce the deal had finally been reached. The inking of a ceasefire deal brings to a halt more than a year of war in Gaza, during which the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 wounded. The three-phase deal will begin with “a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded” over a period of six weeks, Biden explained. The second phase, which is still being negotiated, would see a “permanent end to the war,” he added. Biden said the deal would end “more than 15 months of conflict” that began with the “brutal assault” on Israel, as well as “more than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families and the Israeli people,” and “more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza.” He added that he and Vice President Kamala Harris “cannot wait” to welcome American hostages home. He stressed that the ceasefire would continue past the six-week period if the negotiations take longer. The second phase of the deal would involve releasing “all remaining living hostages,” and a withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. At that point, the ceasefire would become permanent, Biden said. He added that a third phase would consist of the return of the remains of any deceased hostages, plus the start of a “major reconstruction plan” for Gaza. Biden also made a point of noting in his Wednesday speech that the ceasefire agreement is one he “introduced” last spring, but said his team has been working closely with the incoming Trump administration in the final days of the deal negotiations. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” he said. For his part, Trump attempted to take sole credit for the agreement in a post to his Truth Social platform, writing that the “EPIC” agreement “could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.” “With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven,” he added. Asked about Trump’s boasts and claims to be responsible for the deal, Biden grinned and pointed out that the agreement largely follows the framework he proposed last May. He credited American support for Israel with having helped to “badly weaken Hamas and its’ backers and create the conditions for this deal,” and stressed that he’d known all along that the deal would have to be implemented by Trump and his team. “So I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we’re all speaking with the same voice,” he said. “Because that’s what American presidents do.” In a separate statement, the president said the agreement had been the product of “intense diplomacy.” The agreement — which Biden called a result of both “the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran” along with “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy” — tracks the details first laid out in a United Nations Security Council-endorsed plan put forth by the United States last year. On Monday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that efforts to close the deal were ongoing and had “accelerated” in recent weeks, with McGurk, a veteran diplomat and foreign policy expert who has served in multiple administrations, having “camped out” in Doha while “working to tighten up these details and try to get this done.” Sullivan said Biden’s team had “coordinated very closely” with the incoming Trump team to “present a united message to all the parties, which says it is in the American national security interest — regardless of party, regardless of outgoing or incoming administration” and “get this deal done as fast as possible.” The way the talks had run up against an American presidential transition had brought to mind the chaotic scenario faced by Ronald Reagan when he succeeded Jimmy Carter after defeating him in the 1980 election amid the Iran hostage crisis. At the time and in the years since, it has been argued by some historians that the Reagan team back-channeled with Iran to keep the hostages captive until Reagan took office — as they were in fact released just minutes after he was sworn in. Asked whether he or Biden were concerned that the negotiations were being hampered by American political considerations, Sullivan said he doubted the thought had even crossed Biden’s mind. “What was on his mind is we’re in this period of change and transition, and we can’t have anything missed between the cup and the lip in the handoff between our administration and the incoming administration. So, he told us, he told me, ‘Sit down with your successor as soon as you possibly can and start working through and mapping out what they need to know and how we can work together in this period of transition to put ourselves in the best position possible,’” he said. “These are not partisan issues; these are American national security issues. And it’s the kind of spirit that President Biden has brought to this job from the very beginning that set the politics aside, do what’s right for the country, and have our team work with the incoming team in that regard,” Sullivan continued, adding that the engagement between the Biden and Trump teams had been “professional” as well as “deep and substantive.”"
3,Everything we know about North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine,"0    https://www.aol.com/everything-know-north-kore...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Ukraine has found “irrefutable evidence” of North Korea’s involvement in Russia’s war against his country, president Volodymyr Zelensky said this week as he announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers. The two men were reportedly captured during fighting in Russia’s Kursk border region, where the Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last August. North Korea has deployed some 12,000 troops to aid Russia’s war effort, Ukraine has said, echoing assessments by American and South Korean intelligence agencies. Kyiv previously claimed to have caught a North Korean soldier in Kursk on 27 December, but later said he had died of his wounds. The two soldiers captured on Saturday were brought to Kyiv for interrogation. Pictures released on social media by Mr Zelensky show two men resting on cots in a prison cell with bars over the windows. Both wear bandages, one around his jaw and the other around his hands and wrists. Mr Zelensky did not give their names but the Ukrainian intelligence service claimed that one of them carried a Russian military ID card issued in the name of a person from the Tuva republic bordering Mongolia. The other man possessed no documents when he was captured. Moscow was “trying to hide the fact these are soldiers from North Korea by giving them documents claiming they are from Tuva or other territories under Moscow’s control. But these people are actually Koreans, they are from North Korea,” the president’s office said, without offering any evidence. Since the captured soldiers did not speak English, Russian or Ukrainian, they were interviewed with the help of a Korean translator, the Security Service of Ukraine said. The soldier with the ID card purportedly said he was born in 2005 and was serving in the North Korean military as a rifleman since 2021. The other prisoner answered his interrogators in writing due to a severe injury to his jaw. He purportedly said that he was serving in the North Korean army since 2016 as a scout sniper. One of the soldiers purportedly said during his interrogation that he had been told he was on a training exercise and did not know he was fighting the Ukrainian forces. The testimony was confirmed by the other soldier, the security service said. The man claimed to have hid in a shelter during fighting and stayed there until he was found by the Ukrainians a few days later. His unit had suffered significant losses and food and water shortages for several days before his capture, he purportedly said. The unit had received a single week of training alongside Russian troops before being deployed to the frontline. “This task was not easy,” Mr Zelensky said about the capture of the two men. “Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state, North Korea, in the war against Ukraine is preserved.” South Korea’s intelligence agency claimed to have found North Korean memos calling on its soldiers to kill themselves before capture by the Ukrainians. Mr Zelensky said that he was ready to send the two soldiers to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he were to facilitate a prisoner exchange with Russia. “Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,"" he said on X on Sunday. “For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available,” he added. “In particular, those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given that opportunity.”"
4,"For LA water issues, misinformation spreads nearly as fast as the wildfires","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/la-water-issues-mis...
Name: Link, dtype: object","A billionaire couple was accused of withholding water that could help stop Los Angeles' massive wildfires. Democratic leadership was blamed for fire hydrants running dry and for an empty reservoir. Firefighters were criticized for allegedly using “women's handbags"" to fight the fires. Those are just a few of the false or misleading claims that have emerged amid general criticism about California's water management sparked by the fierce Los Angeles fires. Much of the misinformation is being spread “because it offers an opportunity to take potshots at California Democratic leadership while simultaneously distracting attention from the real contributing factors, especially the role of climate change,” said Peter Gleick, senior fellow at the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit he co-founded that focuses on global water sustainability. Attacks on a water bank Social media users have claimed that Stewart and Lynda Resnick, co-owners of a massive agriculture company that has a majority stake in California’s Kern Water Bank, control California’s water and have refused to lend enough to firefighting efforts. The water bank stores up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water underground for agricultural, municipal and industrial use during dry years. The water gets used by the Resnicks' company, The Wonderful Company, known for such brands as Fiji Water and Wonderful Pistachios. It also serves Bakersfield and other farmers in Kern County. But the water bank is more than 100 miles north of Los Angeles and plays no part in its water supply. The Wonderful Company said there was “zero truth” that it controls California water or has anything to do with water going to Los Angeles. Kern Water Bank didn't respond to a request for comment. The Wonderful Company has faced criticism over its extensive water use, especially in times of drought, and its control of what many consider a public resource. But Gleick said neither the Resnicks nor their company have anything to do with water supply issues around the wildfires. “There are many problems with how California allocates water among users and especially the control of water by large agribusinesses, exemplified by the Resnicks, but those problems are completely unrelated to the LA fires and efforts to control them,” he said. Claims over dry hydrants, empty reservoir Some fire hydrants in Los Angeles ran dry in early efforts to fight the fires, prompting a swirl of criticism on social media, including from President-elect Donald Trump, against the water management policies of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. State and local officials and experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information. State water distribution choices were not behind the hydrant problems, they said, nor was a lack of overall supply in the region. Officials said the hydrants were overstressed for hours as aerial firefighting wasn't possible because of high winds. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said they were pumping plenty of water into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn’t enough to refill three million-gallon tanks in Pacific Palisades that help pressurize hydrants there. Janisse Quiñones, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said at a news conference that 3 million gallons of water were available when the Palisades fire started but demand was four times greater than ever seen. Hydrants are designed for fighting fires at one or two houses at a time, not hundreds, Quiñones said, and refilling the tanks also requires asking fire departments to pause firefighting. Bass said 20% of hydrants went dry. Critics also questioned why the 117-million gallon Santa Ynez Reservoir that contributes water for drinking and firefighting in Pacific Palisades was empty when the fires broke out. Some social media users said officials should be jailed over the empty reservoir, or alleged that officials view diversity, equity and inclusion policies as more important than getting things done. The reservoir has been empty for nearly a year awaiting repairs to a rubber cover that were required to provide safe drinking water, according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which owns and operates it. The agency also said competitive bidding requires time. Marty Adams, who retired last spring, was the general manager and chief engineer at LADWP when the reservoir was drained. He said it was difficult to see the full scope of damage without draining the reservoir, and once that was done officials realized the repairs would be a bigger job than expected. Adams said the reservoir likely could not have been refilled fast enough to be of much use fighting fires. Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the hydrants and the reservoir. At least one lawsuit has already been filed over the reservoir issue. Fighting flames with purses? Video of firefighters throwing water onto flames with small bags spread widely on social media. Some posts ridiculed the use of “women's handbags” and alleged money that could have been used to buy proper equipment was spent elsewhere, such as on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives or foreign aid. But the state said the small canvas bags seen in the videos are routinely used by the Los Angeles Fire Department to fight small trash fires, and can be more efficient than a long hose in some situations. Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the Palisades fire, said misinformation is demoralizing for firefighters. “When they hear that there’s a suspicion that they didn’t put their best foot forward, that they weren’t at their best, that they weren’t excellent in terms of the service that they deliver, of course that’s crushing,” she said. Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education, called the misinformation “irresponsible"" and said it affects the actions people take and the way they cope with trauma. “The spread of false information at a time of crisis is nothing short of deadly,” she said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

5,France to decide response to Algeria 'hostility' as tensions mount - minister,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/france-decide-respo...
Name: Link, dtype: object","By John Irish PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron and key members of the government will meet in the coming days to decide how to respond to what Paris deems as growing hostility from Algeria, France's foreign minister said on Wednesday. Ties between Paris and Algiers have been complicated for decades, but have taken a turn for the worse since last July when Macron angered Algeria by recognising a plan for autonomy for the Western Sahara region under Moroccan sovereignty. Although diplomatic ties have not been ruptured, French officials say Algiers is adopting a policy that aims to wipe France's economic presence from the country, with trade falling by as much as 30% since the summer. A poor relationship has major security, economic and social repercussions: trade is extensive and some 10 percent of France's 68 million population has links to Algeria, according to French officials. ""The relationship between France and Algeria is not a bilateral relationship like any other, it is a relationship of deep intimacy,"" Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers, accusing Algeria of taking a ""hostile posture"". Barrot has offered to go to Algeria to discuss the standoff. In November, Algeria's banking association tested the waters verbally to suggest a directive to end banking transactions to and from France, although did not go through with it given the extensive nature of trade ties between the two countries, three diplomats said. Diplomats and traders say French firms are no longer being considered in tenders for wheat imports to Algeria, to which France had been a key exporter. Beyond business, Macron accused Algiers of ""dishonouring itself"" by detaining arbitrarily Franco-Algerian author Boualem Sansal, whose health has worsened in recent weeks. Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has called Sansal an ""imposter"" sent by France. With Macron's government under pressure to toughen immigration policies, a diplomatic spat also broke out last week after several Algerian social media influencers were arrested in France and accused of inciting violence. One was deported to Algiers, where authorities sent him back to Paris, citing legal procedures. That sparked anger among France's right-wing parties and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau accused Algiers of trying to humiliate the former colonial power. ""This is a violation of the texts that govern our relationship and it is a precedent that we consider serious,"" Barrot said, adding that this and the arrest of Sansal had forced Paris' hands to decide how to respond. Algeria's foreign ministry denied on Saturday it was seeking escalation with France and said the far-right in France was carrying out a disinformation campaign against Algeria. PAST TRAUMA The relationship between the two countries is scarred by the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war in which the North African country broke with France. About 400,000 Algerian civilians and fighters were killed, as well as about 35,000 French and as many as 30,000 Muslim ""harkis"" who fought in the French army against Algerian insurgents. Macron has over the years pushed for more transparency regarding France's past with Algeria while also saying that Algeria's ""politico-military system"" had rewritten the history of its colonisation by France based on ""a hatred of France"". Jalel Harchaoui, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said the countries were locked in an escalating standoff. ""Many politicians in Paris say they want to force Algeria to soften its position, but Algiers has every intention to stand firm. Algeria feels all the more emboldened by the fact that France is far less important to its economy than a few years ago,"" he said. (Reporting by John Irish; editing by Philippa Fletcher)"
6,France’s new prime minister hints at tearing up Macron’s state pension reforms,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/france-prime-minist...
Name: Link, dtype: object","France’s new prime minister has hinted at plans to water down Emmanuel Macron’s controversial state pension reforms. In 2023, Macron pushed through legislation that raised the legal age of retirement from 62 to 64 by 2030 in order to help plug France’s ballooning deficit – despite bitter resistance from political opponents, unions and the French public. However, François Bayrou, France’s prime minister, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the reforms would be “renegotiated” in a bid to win over Left-wing lawmakers he needs to pass the 2025 budget in a hung parliament. Mr Bayrou, a close Macron ally, was appointed a month ago after Michel Barnier, the previous prime minister, was ousted in a no-confidence vote. The most contested part of the reform – being the minimum age of 64 to draw a full pension – should not be “a taboo” in the review over the coming months, Mr Bayrou said. But he warned that France’s growing debt pile was a “sword of Damocles” hanging over future generations’ heads, and that any new deal will have to be financially balanced. If it can’t be balanced, the current deal would remain in place, he added. Some centre-Right MPs, alarmed by France’s deteriorating public finances, cheered Mr Bayrou’s decision to rule out a repeal or suspension of the pension reform demanded by the Socialist Party (PS) and its allies. Mr Macron’s ambitious, and deeply unpopular flagship policy, has helped undermine his position as president. In parliamentary elections this summer, a majority of voters backed parties opposed to the president’s reforms. France Unbowed, the largest party in the Left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, wants to reduce the state pension age from 62 to 60. Marine Le Pen’s far-Right National Rally party has also floated the idea. Under Mr Macron’s reforms, France’s legal age of retirement will gradually rise from 62 to 64 by 2030. Citizens will need to work for 43 years – up from 42 – to receive a full state pension, which averages around €1,500 (£1,265) a month. By contrast, Britain’s state pension age is set to rise from 66 to 67 by 2026. Protests erupted across France in 2023 as millions of workers demanded the policy be reversed – as well as an improvement to economic conditions more generally. However, analysts believe that in order to balance the books, the government will need to take an axe to France’s generous pension system – which accounts for over a quarter of public spending. France has one of the lowest retirement ages in Europe and one of the highest state pension entitlements relative to the cost of living. The French state pension is based on a final salary calculation. On average, pensioners receive around 74pc of their pre-retirement earnings, according to research from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The figure stands in stark contrast to just 58pc for British retirees, and an average of 68pc across the European Union. Mr Bayrou’s new government is under mounting pressure to make €60bn in tax hikes and spending cuts to tackle France’s fiscal black hole. France is currently operating under an emergency budget law to avoid the shutdown of the government. Mr Macron’s decision to call snap legislative elections in June has thrown the National Assembly into turmoil after his centrists lost the poll, strengthening the far-Right and a Leftist alliance. Mr Bayrou said on Tuesday: “No one denies that there is a huge problem with financing our pension system. At the same time, many people who have participated in these discussions have agreed that we will be able to reach the same result with a more just reform. “So I propose to go back to take a fresh look at the pension reform using a radical approach, based on figures that are beyond debate. “We will set up a fast-track mission in the following weeks to take stock of the present situation to see where we stand exactly. “The law of 2023 provided for the age for retiring moved to 63 by 2026. But I’m convinced that we will be able to find a new type of reform without any taboos and nothing that is off-limits, even the issue of the age of retirement. “What is imperative is not to turn our back on the fiscal unbalance of this debt.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

7,"From Baptist churches to Buddhist temples, religious groups volunteer for fire...","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/baptist-churches-bu...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Moninder Singh has spent the past week serving food and beverages at a Gurdwara — a Sikh temple — in Covina, California, to hungry victims displaced by Los Angeles County’s devastating wildfires. “When we serve chai, there is a glow on people’s faces like we are giving them gold. The pleasure in their eyes is soothing to me,” Singh said. “We are planning to make samosas tomorrow.” Asians Americans are the third-largest racial group in L.A. and the most religiously diverse group in the U.S. This diversity, however, is working in unison to lend a hand to the thousands of victims of the Southern California wildfires, the worst ever in the history of the state. Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Taoists, Muslims, Jews and more are all raising money volunteering in many ways to bring relief to their fellow Angelenos. Singh is a member of United Sikhs, a U.N.-affiliated, faith-based group that in the past has been deployed to disaster areas — from hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, for example — and also to war zones in Ukraine. This time, the group has turned its attention to the devastated Los Angeles area. United Sikhs is among several organizations nationwide that have made their way to the area as the fires continue to roar through tens of thousands of acres. For Mehul Patel, a volunteer at the Hindu temple BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, in Chino Hills, it is the concept of Seva, or selfless service, that motivates him to serve his community. “In the joy of others, lies our own,” said Patel, attributing this philosophy to the group’s late president, his holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj. “That is the motto that drives us, the spirit of Seva and service is embedded in our faith,” Patel said. Volunteers from the group started mobilizing within 24 hours of the start of the fires, he said. They organized their first donation drive on Jan. 9, collecting water, first-aid kits and sleeping bags, and bringing them to disaster relief organizations in Pasadena. Now, the Hindu organization has its own fundraising operation to support the victims in their recovery efforts, the #SOCALSTRONG Wildfire Relief and Recovery Fund. “We have been receiving donations from all over the world. It really shows you the global impact that the city of L.A. has had, and people genuinely want to support this effort because of these dire circumstances,” Patel told NBC News. The belief in Seva and selflessly serving those in need is also a guiding philosophy behind the international group United Sikhs. “This is embedded in the Sikh faith, Seva is selfless service. We have spoken out for the voiceless, we have fought for the vulnerable and aided and abetted those who cannot help themselves,” said Gurvinder Singh, international humanitarian aid director at United Sikhs, who is not related to Moninder Singh. The organization’s helpline, called “Umeed,” is mostly receiving calls from those who have been affected by the Los Angeles wildfires. While there are many in need, Singh told NBC News that there are also many who wish to volunteer. Moninder Singh at United Sikhs previously helped with disaster relief during Hurricane Helene. In India, where he lived until four months ago, he owned five restaurants. He lost everything during the Covid-19 pandemic. “God has sent me to be among these people,” Moninder Singh said. The Sikh group served over 1,300 meals on Sunday, Gurvinder Singh said. “Not including snacks, emergency supplies and clothing. That’s just hot meals which are a part of Langar, free meals for anyone served in Gurdwaras,” he said. It is his hope that when people see someone wearing a turban or having the word “Sikh” written on their clothing, people will know that they are going to be helped. Tzu Chi USA, a Buddhist nonprofit, has been mobilizing its members as well, gathering donations and supplies for disaster relief and organizing an interfaith prayer on Jan. 7 at their San Gabriel Valley Service Center. Local churches have also been at the helm of disaster aid relief. Justin Chang is the minister of Community Outreach for Mandarin Baptist Church of Los Angeles, a multicultural church with services in English, Mandarin and Cantonese. “We had a few members who were affected, some who lost their homes, and we have been trying to see how to help them,” Chang said. According to Chang, the international aid organization World Vision contacted his church as they were looking for organizations that could help the group distribute supplies in the Los Angeles area. Chang told NBC News that on Saturday they were able to help 10 families through their distribution drive as they passed out blankets, water, school supplies, toys, hygiene kits, socks and masks. “Some of our church members are more well-off and are able to stay with friends and family. But some have lost everything and so are taking whatever they need,” Chang said. In the case of Masjid Al-Taqwa, a Sunni Muslim mosque in Altadena, California, everything has been lost. The Masjid, which has been a pillar of its community since the 1970s, was a casualty of the Eaton Fire on Jan. 7. Jihad Saafir, former imam of the mosque and community partner, said the mosque was a pivotal community center, founded by African American Muslims in the Nation of Islam before transitioning to mainstream Sunni practice in 1975. The imam said the prayer service gathered people of all faiths. “You have an Egyptian family praying next to a Pakistani family, praying next to a Bangladeshi family, and praying next to a black family. It’s a diverse community.” A crowdfunding campaign on the online platform LaunchGood was organized by members of the local and international Muslim community. It has now raised over $700,000 to restore the Masjid, which was the first mosque in the Pasadena area. The campaign also attracted attention online, including from prominent Muslim voices in the United States. “It’s beautiful seeing everyone coming together, this community is a community of light,” Saafir said. “It is a temporary setback for a beautiful comeback, I have faith, and a lot of people are rooting for Masjid Al Taqwa.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com"
8,Hostage deal shows Hamas took Trump's 'hell to pay' threat seriously,"0    https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hostage-deal-s...
Name: Link, dtype: object","President Biden had a curt response to a question posed by Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on Wednesday regarding whether President-elect Trump deserves credit for the recent Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal. Incoming President Donald Trump has repeatedly issued stern warnings to Hamas in the past few weeks, saying that there will be ""hell to pay"" if Israeli hostages are not released by the time he returns to office on Jan. 20. Wednesday's announcement that an agreement between Israel and Hamas was near, providing for a temporary cease-fire and the release of 33 Israeli hostages, made clear that the ""Trump Factor"" played a pivotal role in pushing this deal forward. TRUMP PROMISES ‘HELL TO PAY’ IN MIDDLE EAST IF HOSTAGES ARE NOT RELEASED BEFORE HE TAKES OFFICEThese 33 Israeli hostages to be freed under the deal, along with 65 others still held by Hamas in Gaza in sub-human conditions for the past 466 days, were snatched from their homes and their beds on a Saturday morning of the Jewish holiday of Simchat on Oct. 7, 2023. Ever since that day, their names and faces have become one with the Israeli collective. Their stories have become our own. Israelis are immensely grateful to President-elect Trump for his commitment and tenacity, as well as to the thousands of brave Israeli men and women of the IDF who have risked life and limb to resurrect Israel from the horrible failure of that fateful day. Memorials at the site of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im, Israel, are pictured on May 27, 2024. (Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The hostages' return is both painful and joyous for Israelis traumatized by the war. Reuniting those innocent people with their families brings tears of joy to our eyes, knowing well the kind of torment, suffering, torture and abuse they suffer at the hands of Hamas' merciless and cruel captors. Yet, it is also a harsh reminder of the magnitude of Israel's failure and of the need to guarantee that such an event never happens again.Trump's ""hell to pay"" was a clear message not just to Hamas, but to all rogue actors of the Middle East. It was a manifestation of the incoming administration's clear moral vision and ability to tell right from wrong, a vision that has the chance to herald a new episode in the future of this tumultuous and fickle region. A clear line stretches between this statement and January 2020, when, at the direction of then-President Trump, the U.S. military took out Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.  Newly released records from the FBI prove that Iran was behind a potential assassination attempt on former President Trump.  (Getty Images) Soleimani was the architect of evil, responsible for the Islamic Regime's ""Ring of Fire"" doctrine, surrounding Israel with hostile forces including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as supporting other nefarious terrorist forces, such as the Houthis in Yemen. The assassination of Soleimani sent shock waves through the region and the ranks of the Islamic Republic's leadership, which promised revenge against Trump himself and senior officials in his administration. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn launching the barbaric and ferocious Oct. 7 attack against Israel, Hamas' leader, Yahya Al-Sinwar, was hoping to see all elements of this ""Ring of Fire"" converge and attack Israel in a desire to change the Middle East forever. Four hundred sixty-six days into the war, it is clear that the Middle East has changed forever, but in the opposite direction.Iran and its proxies have suffered significant setbacks. Hamas in Gaza has been decimated. The Assad regime in Syria was toppled, and in Lebanon, a new president and prime minister have been elected, both against the will of a much-weakened Hezbollah. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIsrael is about to go through an excruciating period of seeing our hostages come back from the darkness of Gaza as we eagerly await the rest to return home.Yet, on the horizon, a new future looms: one of ""hell to pay"" for the Middle East's rogue actors, enveloped by hope for peace through strength.

11,Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire days before Trump takes power,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-hamas-agree-...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed a ceasefire to end 15 months of war, with the first hostages set to be released on Sunday. Donald Trump hailed the “epic deal” on Wednesday night, claiming that it could only have happened because of his election victory in November. Hostages will be swapped for Hamas prisoners held in Israel over the course of months under the deal, which has been separated into three separate phases. Click here for Thursday’s live blog on Israel-Hamas deal It will end with a permanent ceasefire, the full military withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of hostages and remains from Hamas tunnels. Joe Biden, the US president, also took credit for the deal from White House on Wednesday night, saying “my diplomacy” forced the agreement. Civilians celebrated on the streets of Tel Aviv and Gaza alike after the deal was announced, despite reports of additional 11th-hour demands by Hamas. The Israeli cabinet was set to vote the deal through on Thursday. The first phase of the deal will last six weeks and will see 33 hostages, including women and children, released. The Israeli military will leave populated areas during that time. The second phase will see remaining male hostages released and the withdrawal of remaining Israeli forces. The third phase will see the bodies of murdered hostages returned to their families, and the reconstruction of Gaza. Mr Biden said the road to the deal “has not been easy” and that the negotiations had been complicated by attacks on Israel from Iran and Hezbollah. “This is one of the toughest negotiations I have ever experienced,” he said. The American negotiating team was formed of US government officials and Mr Trump’s team, who worked together to secure an agreement in line with ceasefire plans outlined by Mr Biden in May. Mr Trump claimed credit for the agreement, arguing that his election victory in November had “[sic] signalled to the entire world that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies”. The president-elect, who will take office on Monday, sent his Middle East envoy to Doha earlier this week to secure the ceasefire before his inauguration on Jan 20. He warned that Hamas would have “hell to pay” if it did not release the hostages. Any agreement still needs to be approved by the Israeli cabinet, but the first stage of the truce is expected to come into effect with the backing of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. Asked whether he or Mr Trump should take credit for the deal, Mr Biden replied: “Is that a joke?” Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said the world’s attention must now switch to securing a “permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution”. But Ehud Olmert, the former Israel prime minister, said he had “doubt and fear” that the deal would bring an end to the war because not all Israeli hostages would be freed under its terms. “There is not really an agreement about a permanent ceasefire,” he told Sky News. “There is an agreement for a temporary ceasefire, for I think about 42 days, maybe six weeks, and the return of only 33 hostages. “There are still more hostages [not released] and we do not know how many will be alive when this [first] phase will end.” Families of British citizens murdered by Hamas warned that there would “never be any closure” until all hostages are returned. Ayelet Svatitzky, who lost her brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell, said: “We’ll be worried and we’re not able to move on until the last hostage is home.” Stephen Brisley, whose sister Lianne Sharabi was killed with her daughters Noiya and Yahel, warned that the deal had “many moving parts that could very easily fall apart”. “Because there have been so many false dawns, there’s still that part of me that isn’t really allowing myself to believe it still, despite the fact that it’s been formally announced,” he said. The ceasefire deal raises questions about the governance of Gaza, where both Israel and the US say Hamas cannot continue to rule. Marco Rubio, the incoming Secretary of State, said in response to the announcement that Israel “cannot coexist with armed elements who seek [its] destruction and evisceration as a state”. Negotiations over the second phase of the ceasefire are expected to begin almost immediately after the first phase comes into force. Israeli troops that withdraw from Gaza will be stationed on the border between the territories, ready to receive hostages released by Hamas. The Israeli government said that Hamas introduced eleventh-hour demands for the IDF to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land between Gaza and Egypt. Mr Netanyahu’s office said Hamas had “folded” due to his “strong insistence” that the troops remain in the short term. Thanks for tuning in to our coverage of Israel’s ceasefire deal with Hamas. This liveblog is now closed. Israeli political leaders have called on Benjamin Netanyahu to approve the hostage-ceasefire deal in a vote scheduled for tomorrow. President Isaac Herzog said he supports the prime minister and the negotiating team for its efforts to reach a deal and said the cabinet must approve the deal “to bring our sons and daughters home”. “There is no higher Jewish value than returning captives home,” he added. Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s opposition, also voiced a note of caution, stating: “An entire country is holding its breath tonight.” Mr Netanyahu has made no public on the deal so far, but had previously insisted that he will not agree to permanently end the war until Hamas’ military capabilities have been dismantled. President Joe Biden said that his negotiators and Donald Trump’s incoming administration worked  as “one team” to get the ceasefire deal agreed. “This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration,” Mr Biden said, taking care to note the responsibility on the incoming president to see the deal through to its conclusion. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” Mr Biden continued. “This has been a time of real turmoil in the Middle East, but as I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and those are genuine opportunities for a new future.” President Joe Biden has pledged to bring home the remaining American hostages as part of the ceasefire deal. “I am also if thinking of the American families, three of whom have living hostages in Gaza and four awaiting return of remains after what has been the most horrible ordeal imaginable,” he said. “Under this deal, we are determined to bring all of them home.” Seven American hostages are still being held in Gaza. The three Americans presumed to be alive are Edan Alexander, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, while four others have been declared dead and their remains have yet to be returned. Families of Israeli hostages issued a statement through the Hostages and Missing Families Forum sharing their “overwhelming joy and relief” over the cease-fire deal. The statement also expressed “deep anxiety and concerns” about the possibility of some hostages being left behind. “We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out,” the statement said. President Joe Biden praised members of his administration who brokered the ceasefire deal, saying: “blessed are the peacemakers”. Taken a degree of personal credit for the agreement, Mr Biden said that he had laid out the “precise contours” of the deal last May and that that proposal was supported by the UN Security Council. He also thanked members of his administration for the “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy”. “Many peacemakers help make this deal happen, including an extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked non stop for months to get this done,” he said, citing the efforts of secretary of state Anthony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and vice president Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden has said the ceasefire deal will enable aid to flow into Gaza after months of pressure from humanitarian groups. “This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,” Mr Biden said in a statement. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said that the world’s attention must now switch to securing a “permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution”. Sir Keir said in a statement: “After months of devastating bloodshed and countless lives lost, this is the long-overdue news that the Israeli and Palestinian people have desperately been waiting for. They have borne the brunt of this conflict – triggered by the brutal terrorists of Hamas, who committed the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust on October 7th, 2023. “For the innocent Palestinians whose homes turned into a warzone overnight and the many who have lost their lives, this ceasefire must allow for a huge surge in humanitarian aid, which is so desperately needed to end the suffering in Gaza. And then our attention must turn to how we secure a permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution that will guarantee security and stability for Israel, alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine state. The Prime Minister also paid tribute to British hostages killed by Hamas. “We will continue to mourn and remember them,” he said. President Joe Biden has taken personal credit for the ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hamas, saying “this is a ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring”. In a press conference addressing the deal, Mr Biden said: “The road to this deal has not been easy. I worked in foreign policy for decades. This is one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced, and reached this point because of the pressure of Israel built on Hamas backed by ther United States.” Asked by reporters whether Mr Biden or his successor, president-elect Donald Trump, was responsible for brokering the deal, Mr Biden said: “Is that a joke?” Hamas cannot be left to govern Gaza, Marco Rubio has said. The Florida senator, who Donald Trump has picked as his secretary of state, said that Hamas cannot remain in power in Gaza following the announcement of a ceasefire with Israel. Appearing at his confirmation hearing, Mr Rubio said: “You can’t turn it [Gaza] over to people who seek your destruction. “You cannot coexist with armed elements who seek your destruction and evisceration as a state.” Mr Rubio, who has been a staunch ally of Israel, added that the peace deal brokered by the US presents a “historic opportunity” for achieving peace in the war-torn region. He said: “The good news is that potentially, we have had a dynamic shift in the region that has an historic opportunity, if appropriately structured and pursued, that changes the dynamics of what might be possible.” Among the possibilities suggested by Mr Rubio was the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s prime minister, has confirmed some of the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas. The first phase of the agreement will last for 42 days, bringing in a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the east - away from populated areas. “Israeli forces will then be positioned along the Gaza border which will allow for the swap of prisoners as well as the swap of remains and the return of the displaced people to their residences,” he added. Al Thani said 33 Israeli hostages will be released by Hamas in return for “a number of prisoners who are being held in Israeli prisons”. Joe Biden has confirmed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in a statement posted on X. “My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done – I will speak more about this soon,” the outgoing US president said. It comes after Donald Trump confirmed the hostage deal in a post on his Truth social. Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done – I will speak more about this soon. pic.twitter.com/iETWhGXEGA — President Biden (@POTUS) January 15, 2025 The ceasefire will take effect from Jan 19, according to the Qatari PM - the day before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Exact timings are yet to be confirmed. A reminder, this deal still needs to be signed off by the Israeli cabinet. Qatar’s prime minister has confirmed a ceasefire deal has been agreed between Israel and Hamas and that it will involve the release of Israeli hostages. A press conference involving the prime minister Qatar has begun. We’ll bring you updates as they come in. You can also watch the conference at the top of this page. Israeli forces will withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor - a strategic ribbon of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt - and complete it no later than day 50 of the truce, according to a copy of the deal, obtained by Reuters. Benjamin Netanyahu forced Hamas to fold on its it final demands at the last hour, his office said in a statement. “Due to the strong insistence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas folded on its last-minute demand to change the deployment of IDF forces in the Philadelphi Corridor. However, several items in the framework have yet to be finalized; we hope that the details will be finalized tonight.” Egyptian state media has reported that talks are underway to “open the Palestinian Rafah crossing to allow the entry of international aid” into Gaza, citing an Egyptian security source. Egypt was “preparing to bring in the largest possible amount of aid to the Gaza Strip”, the report said, following news of the ceasefire deal. There are several “minor” issues being finalised over the ceasefire and hostage deal that will be sorted before it is implemented, a senior official involved in the talks told The Times of Israel. The issues include Israel finishing vetting the 1,000 Palestinian prisoners slated to be released under the deal, the official said. An Israeli air strike killed five Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin Wednesday, the local health ministry said shortly after news broke of a ceasefire deal in Gaza. The majority of Israelis will be celebrating the ceasefire but with a certain bittersweet feeling. Many of the hostages are dead, hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed and the Hamas members with blood on their hands are going to be released from Israeli jails. Benjamin Netanyahu will undoubtedly boost his popularity when the hostages are released, but for most Israelis he remains a villain who puts his own personal interest above the nation’s. Hamas has been significantly weakened and lost control over Gaza. Rebuilding the organisation will take years, and many Palestinians will hold them responsible for the dearth and destruction they brought on Gaza. The only real winner in all this is the Palestinian Authority, which is preparing to position itself as the next ruler of Gaza. But the road to power in the enclave is long and full of challenges. “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies. I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones. “With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven. We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World! “We have achieved so much without even being in the White House. Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!” The long-awaited truce agreement “could not come soon enough,” said Dr Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, adding that it was Donald Trump’s “pressure tactics” that brought it over the finish line. “Donald Trump’s pressure tactics and warnings to Hamas and Israel have clearly been effective in reviving the drawn-out negotiations where the Biden administration proved unwilling to exert adequate pressure over Israel’s leadership,” she said. Dr Vakil also noted that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, also managed to silence opposition from hard-Right ministers “to deliver a ceasefire arrangement that would have benefitted Trump.” “Netanyahu also hopes to gain by seizing the momentum of Israeli gains across the region and further influencing the incoming US team to support more military efforts to set back Iran’s nuclear programme,” she added. Israel’s government will vote on the hostage and ceasefire deal on Wednesday, an Israeli government official told Reuters. The vote will take place at 11:00am local time (9am GMT) on Wednesday, according to Israeli media reports. Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages, including all women (soldiers and civilians), children and men over 50. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a six-week initial ceasefire phase. This includes the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from central Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to north Gaza, an official briefed on the talks told Reuters. The ceasefire deal has been reached, the Axios news website, citing a US official, said. Gideon Saar, Israel’s foreign minister, has cut short his diplomatic visit to Italy due to the progress made in the Gaza truce talks. In a statement, the foreign ministry said Mr Saar will return to Israel tonight to take part in the expected security cabinet and government votes on a deal. He had been scheduled to travel to Hungary tomorrow to attend further diplomatic talks. The Qatari update expected to have begun at 7pm local time (4pm GMT) has been delayed. Qatar’s prime minister is expected to make a hostage deal announcement tonight, with Qatari media reports suggesting he will say the deal has been signed. The country has been hosting the talks in Doha to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, which now appears imminent. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who is also foreign minister, will confirm that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement, Qatari outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported. The conference had been due to start at 4pm GMT, but has now been delayed. Ruwaida Amer, who lives in Gaza, spoke of the excitement of a deal edging closer but said she and her friends “don’t have the energy to wait one more day”. “People are very excited for this moment, they want to get back to their homes and be with their loved ones again…I want to return to the north, to get to Gaza City, my people are there, all my life was there,” she told The Telegraph. “But people are also worried that there could be problems that stop this agreement from happening today or tomorrow. “The feelings here are complex between happy and worried. .. The bombing is very hard, for us in Gaza, we know the last hours of the war could be the hardest, people are trying not to move because they do not want to die in the last moments of this war before a ceasefire.” Israeli air strikes in Gaza have continued as a ceasefire with Hamas edges closer. Palestinians have been pictured inspecting the aftermath of a strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, earlier on Wednesday. The Israeli military, the Shin Bet internal intelligence agency and the air force attacked about 50 targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours, Shin Bet and the military confirmed in a statement, killing at least 13 people. Those included seven people who were in a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, and six others killed in separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah, Bureij camp and Rafah, medics said. Hamas has only given “verbal approval” to a Gaza ceasefire proposal under negotiation in Qatar, an anonymous Palestinian official told Reuters on Wednesday. The Palestinian terror group was waiting for “more information” before giving a final written approval, the official added. Members of the Bibas family, the relatives of two children being held hostage in Gaza along with their mother, said they were aware of reports that their loved ones could be released under an imminent ceasefire deal. However, they said they consider “nothing final” until their relatives cross the Israeli border. “Given our experience with disappointments, we consider nothing final until our loved ones cross the border,” a spokesman said. “We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and condition, and request not to be contacted during this sensitive time. We ask that people refrain from spreading rumors. We continue to appeal to the Prime Minister and demand the return of everyone, until the last hostage is home.” Just minutes after an Israeli official briefed that Hamas had given the green light to the ceasefire deal, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office quickly moved to torpedo the report. The statement once again showed the chaotic nature of the leaks coming from all parties involved in the negotiates. The endless stream of leaks and reports have previously caused damaged to talks, with both Hamas and Mr Netanyahu accusing the other of sabotage. With so many officials from different countries deeply involved in negotiations, the leaks are often closely linked to their individual self-interests and attempts to dominate the narrative. Civilians in Gaza and the families of hostages in Israel are, as usual, the ones caught in the emotional roller coaster. Republican Senator Tom Cotton has launched a scathing attack on the Biden administration over the proposed ceasefire-hostages deal in Gaza. “Why is lame duck Joe Biden trying to cram down a bad deal on Israel on his way out the door? “ the senator for Arkansas wrote on X, adding: “The only “deal” should be unconditional surrender by Hamas”. The senator took issue with reports that Israel would be releasing “dozens of hardened terrorists for every one hostage”. “Here’s the ‘deal’ to offer Hamas and its patron, Iran: you have five days to release ALL the hostages or we ‘unleash hell’,” he said. Hamas must be fully destroyed and can play no part in the governance of Gaza, Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser has warned. Speaking to the Call Me Back podcast with Dan Senor, Mike Waltz criticised the Biden administration for “tapping the breaks” on arming Israel and pledged firmer support. “We’ve been clear that Gaza has to be fully demilitarised, Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute,” he said, adding: “These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist, torturers that never should ever have any role in governing.” The incoming adviser’s intervention comes at a tense time for negotiations in Doha, as Israeli officials appeared to contradict each other in statements on the progress of the deal. Finance Minister and security cabinet member Betzalel Smotrich issued a statement on Wednesday morning, saying Israel is at a “crucial and fateful moment for the security, future and existence of the State of Israel.” “What stands before me is only one thing, which I pursue with awe and reverence: how to achieve the full goals of the war – a complete victory, the total destruction of Hamas, both on its military wing and civilian [infrastructure] and the return of all hostages,” Mr Smotrich said. The Religious Zionism party leader has previously railed against a deal with Hamas, claiming it endangers Israel’s security by giving concessions to the terror group. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, called on Mr Smotrich on Tuesday to inform Benjamin Netanyahu that they would both leave the government if a ceasefire is reached. The Palestinian Authority must be the sole governing power in Gaza after the war, the Palestinian prime minister said on Wednesday. Speaking at a conference in Norway, Mohammed Mustafa said: “While we’re waiting for the ceasefire, it’s important to stress that it will not be acceptable for any entity to govern Gaza Strip but the legitimate Palestinian leadership and the government of the State of Palestine.” He added: “We are the government of Palestine, ready to hold our responsibilities in the Gaza Strip as we did before.” Israel has opposed any involvement by PA, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago which lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas in 2007. Israeli officials have accused the PA of supporting attacks against Israel and expressed concern that any Palestinian state would inevitably be taken over by the Islamist group. Pete Hegseth, president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defence secretary, has declared his support for “destroying” Hamas. Speaking at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, the former Fox news host said: “I support Israel destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.” Mr Hegseth’s opening statement was interrupted by a series of hecklers branding him “a Christian Zionist” who “supports the war in Gaza by the Zionists.” The 44-year-old responded: “I’m a Christian and I robustly support the State of Israel and its existential defence.” An Islamic Jihad official told AFP on Wednesday that a delegation from the Palestinian militant group had arrived in Qatar to participate in talks on the ceasefire in Gaza and prisoner exchange with Israel. “A high-ranking delegation from Islamic Jihad arrived in Doha on Tuesday evening,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that “discussions are ongoing, focusing on the mechanism for implementing the ceasefire agreement and the names of Palestinian prisoners included in the exchange deal”. The group is thought to have captured and held a number of hostages separately from Hamas. The Kremlin said it was following progress towards a ceasefire in Gaza with “cautious optimism”, adding that a truce between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory was “extremely necessary for the people of Gaza”. “It can only be viewed with cautious optimism,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday of steps towards a ceasefire deal. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza s,has aid that 62 people were killed in the Palestinian territory in the past 24 hours, taking the Palestinian death toll to 46,707. The ministry said at least 110,265 people have been wounded in more than 15 months of conflict between Israel and Hamas, triggered by the Palestinian group’s Oct 7, 2023 attack. An Israeli diplomatic source has accused Hamas of fabricating claims that Israel is seeking to delay the ceasefire-hostage deal with last-minute demands. “Hamas is falsely claiming that Israel added new demands in the talks to avoid finalising the deal,” the source told The Telegraph. Negotiating teams in Doha had previously indicated that a deal was hours or days away from being signed, but no final agreement has been announced and cracks have started to appear. Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of attempting to sabotage the ceasefire-hostage deal by a senior Palestinian source speaking to the Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news agency. The anonymous source claimed the Israeli prime minister insisted at the last minute that Israeli soldiers held hostage by Hamas were included in the list of 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the agreement. According to a copy of the agreement obtained by the Associated Press, the first stage would see the release of all civilian hostages and five female soldiers. For every civilian hostage freed, 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released, while each Israeli female soldier would warrant 50 Palestinian prisoners - including 30 serving life sentences. General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command that oversees operations in the Middle East, was in Israel for talks with his Israeli counterpart Herzi Halevi. “The commanders held a strategic meeting that focused on the regional situational assessment and examined courses of action to address threats and developments in the Middle East,” the military said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the general had arrived in Israel on Monday. “The two discussed a variety of possible scenarios on both near and distant fronts, emphasising the strengthening of operational cooperation and enhancing readiness for any scenario,” the military added. The first stage of the proposed truce, which is expected to last six weeks, would see Hamas release 33 of the 94 Israeli hostages held in Gaza. In return, Israel would release around 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, withdraw troops from populated areas of Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to flood in. Negotiators in Doha are still finalising the exact parameters of the IDF’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, Arab officials told the Times of Israel. Read the full story on how the truce is expected to be implemented here.  Mohammed Mustafa, the Palestinian prime minister, has urged the international community to exert pressure on Israel after an imminent ceasefire in Gaza so it accepts the creation of a Palestinian state. “The ceasefire we’re talking about ... came about primarily because of international pressure. So pressure does pay off,” Mr Mustafa told a conference in Oslo. Israel must “be shown what’s right and what’s wrong, and that the veto power on peace and statehood for Palestinians will not be accepted and tolerated any longer,” he added. Israel has warned institutions such as hospitals that it should prepare to receive a number of hostages starting on Sunday, according to Israeli broadcaster Channel 12. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the Health Ministry’s public health division, told Israeli outlet Ynet that the condition of hostages returning after more than a year in captivity will be “very different” to when Hamas released 105 civilians in late November 2023. After a deal has been announced, it will be submitted to the Israeli government for approval. A list of names of the Palestinian prisoners set for release will then be published, to which the public have 48 hours to object before the deal is implemented, according to the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news agency. Exhausted families of hostages are growing impatient with the delay in the ceasefire talks as conflicting reports about the deal have been circulating in the media the past 48 hours. Thousands of Israelis protested again on Tuesday evening, with some demanding from the government that all hostages be released at the same time in a deal with Hamas. Many fear that the hostages who aren’t on the list of the 33 hostages set to be released in the first phase could end up being left behind if the ceasefire collapses before the second stage. This is what happened in the last ceasefire in November, which Hamas broke on the last day of the deal by firing rockets at Israel in the early morning hours. The calm before the storm is also seen by some in Israel as a deliberate attempt by Hamas to cause further psychological terror in the Israeli public. Israel is in a “waiting game”, as one source familiar with the ceasefire talks described it to The Telegraph, with disagreements over the implementation of the deal causing delay. Israeli airstrikes on two homes in central Gaza killed at least 17 Palestinians late on Tuesday and wounded seven more, hospital officials said. In the occupied West Bank, the Health Ministry said at least six people were killed by an Israeli airstrike in the Jenin refugee camp. The Israeli military confirmed a drone strike in the area but gave no further details. In the Gaza Strip, the bodies of 11 people were brought to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital after a strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, officials at the hospital said. Another strike killed six people in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp and wounded seven more, according to Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Among those wounded was Khaled Rayan, the head of the nursing department at the hospital. Over the past 24 hours, the Israeli military said it had struck more than 50 “terrorist” targets across the Gaza Strip. Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv’s “hostages square” on Tuesday night in anticipation of a ceasefire deal, with some singing and playing music on a stage. Some of the country’s best-known musicians performed, including Eviatar Banai, Omer Adam and Aviv Geffen. The aunt of murdered hostage Omer Neutra led the crowd in the prayer “Shema Yisrael” before sending strength to the hostage negotiators. “This is not about politics or strategy. It’s about humanity and the shared belief that no one should be left behind in darkness,” said Moran Stella Yanai, one of the hostages released earlier from Gaza. In Jerusalem, hundreds of Israeli hard-liners marched to voice their opposition to the deal, chanting “you don’t make a deal with the devil,” in reference to the Hamas militant group that attacked Israel on Oct 7, 2023. The call last week from Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy was reportedly blunt and short on diplomatic nicety. Steven Witkoff is said to have told aides to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, that he was headed to Israel on Saturday afternoon. When informed that would be in the middle of the sabbath, but the prime minister could meet in the evening, his reply was apparently “salty” and clear, according to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. The sabbath did not interest Mr Witkoff, the aides were told. Read the full story here. A “tense” meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy led to a breakthrough in the ceasefire-hostage negotiations in Doha, two Arab officials have told The Times of Israel. Steven Witkoff, described by a senior Israeli diplomat as a “businessman who charges ahead unusually aggressively”, reportedly told the Israeli president to accept compromises during a sit down in Jerusalem on Saturday. The Florida property investor then flew on to Doha to take part in the hostage negotiations. One of the main issues that has yet to be finalised is the exact parameters of the IDF’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the Arab officials said. The two officials speculated that a deal would be announced in a joint statement by the US, Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday or Thursday. Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi have vowed to remain in close coordination “over the coming hours”, as negotiators seek to finalise a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. “Both leaders committed to remain in close coordination directly and through their teams over the coming hours,” the White House said in a statement after the leaders’ telephone call.

12,"Israel and Hamas reach deal on Gaza ceasefire, hostage release","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-hamas-reach-...
Name: Link, dtype: object","After months of deadlock and more than 15 months of war, Israel and the militant group Hamas reached a fresh Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, President Joe Biden said on Wednesday. The deal includes a six-week initial ceasefire phase, the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, Biden said. ""The road to this deal has not been easy. I've worked in foreign policy for decades, this is one of the toughest negotiations that I've ever experienced,"" Biden said from the White House. ""I've reached this point because ... of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."" Biden said that Americans would be part of the initial release. He did not say how many. Seven Americans are being held hostage by Hamas. Four have been confirmed dead. Three were believed to be alive: Edan Alexander, 21, Keith Siegel, 64, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36. A senior administration official told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Siegel and Dekel-Chen would be released in the first phase of the deal, which applies to women, elderly males and the sick and wounded. Alexander will not be released in the first wave because he is an Israeli soldier. The agreement, which is expected to unfold in three phases beginning Sunday, was mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The truce is intended to halt fighting that has devastated Gaza and destabilized the Middle East. It comes just days before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as 47th president of the United States. The deal also comes after several waves of negotiations stalled and failed to reach a sequel to an agreement reached in November 2023 during which 105 hostages were released in a weeklong truce. As part of that agreement, 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel were freed before fighting resumed. The first phase of the deal was expected to see 33 civilians and 5 female Israeli soldiers held in Gaza released in the first 42 days. In return, Israel will free as many as 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails and its troops will withdraw from city centers in Gaza, a key coastal road and a strategic strip of land along the border with Egypt. Biden said the exact details would be forthcoming. A senior administration official told reporters negotiators would meet on Thursday in Cairo to discuss implementation of the complex agreement. A list of hostages and prisoners who will be released in the first phase of the deal has not been made public, but the official said the U.S. knows exactly who will be freed when the agreement kicks in. Negotiations to reach the second phase, when the remaining hostages would be released, would likely begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. In the second phase, more Israeli troops would also pull out of the Palestinian territory and the temporary ceasefire would become permanent. Biden said the second phase, if it's reached, would mark a permanent end to the war. Phase three would involve the transfer of the remains of deceased hostages to their families and the reconstruction of Gaza. If initial negotiations take more than six weeks, they will continue, Biden said, for as long as a resolution to the conflict takes. ""There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. And I'm deeply satisfied this day has finally come for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza, who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war,"" Biden said. Hamas kidnapped 251 people and killed more than 1,200 on Oct. 7, 2023, when it attacked communities in southern Israel, triggering a massive military response from Israel. Israel's government believes 94 hostages are still in Gaza, 60 of whom are assumed to be alive. Four of the hostages were taken in earlier incidents. Their 20-year-old is a hostage in Gaza: Here's what they know about her condition. More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operation, according to figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million population have been displaced. The war in Gaza has upended the entire Middle East region, mushrooming into Israeli conflicts with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Iran-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran itself. The war also appeared to create conditions that led to the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Trapped in Gaza for a year: Here's her harrowing story Trump and Biden have been vying to claim credit for the agreement before Monday, when Trump takes office. Trump said last month that he wanted a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to be reached before he takes office. Otherwise, he said, there would be ""all hell to pay."" Trump was quick to comment on the agreement Wednesday, claiming his election victory was responsible for the deal. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,"" Trump said in a social media post. Biden said his administration was responsible for the terms of the agreement but he told his team to coordinate closely with Trump's advisers to make sure the U.S. was speaking with one voice. ""I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration. These past few days, we've been speaking as one team,"" Biden said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ""everybody's going to want some credit"" but added ""the president got it done."" ""This is something that's been in the works for months ‒ for months, way before November,"" Jean-Pierre said at a briefing with reporters. ""We're going back and forth about credit, but people are going to get to go home to their families, and that is so important."" A senior administration official told reporters later in the day that the deal was the result of months of diplomacy from the U.S. and its partners in the region and said that in recent days Biden had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu twice. While the Biden administration said the catalyst for the deal was the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and an isolation of Hamas that caused the militant group to agree to release hostages, the official said Trump adviser Steve Witkoff partnered closely with Biden's team and played a significant and helpful role in the diplomacy. ""Hell has been paid to Hamas, tremendously,"" the person said. This article was updated to include video.

13,"Israel, Hamas reach ceasefire after 15 months of brutal war in Gaza","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-hamas-reach-...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Less than 24 hours after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced, Israel delayed a cabinet meeting to approve the agreement as its military continued to attack Gaza, killing at least 77 people, according to local officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of creating a “last-minute crisis” by “reneging” on parts of the agreement, though he did not offer any details about his claim. Hamas has said it was “committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.” Meanwhile, Israel has continued to strike the besieged Palestinian enclave, killing dozens since the deal was announced, Gaza's Civil Defense said. After more than 15 months of destructive fighting that local health officials say has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, Israel and Hamas landed on a ceasefire deal on Wednesday. The agreement, announced by Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani at a news conference, is set to go into effect on Sunday pending the approval of the Israeli Cabinet. The deal is expected to take place in three phases. Under the first stage, which is set to take place over six weeks, Israeli forces are to withdraw from populated areas in Gaza and be stationed along the border, allowing for a hostage swap and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes. Hamas will release 33 hostages — two of whom are Americans — including all women, children and elderly people in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, Al Thani said. Increased humanitarian aid and basic supplies will also be allowed to enter Gaza during this phase. Negotiations over the second and third phases of the deal will take place during the six weeks scheduled for the first, according to Al Thani. The Qatari prime minister stressed the delicate period between the announcement of the deal and its implementation. He underscored the need for both Israel and Hamas to commit to all three stages being carried out. “We hope that over the next few days there will not be any aggressions or any military operations,” he said. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim earlier confirmed to NBC News that the group had agreed to a deal, adding that the same terms had been on the table as early as last May. “We are very happy to reach a deal today to stop the aggression against our people, but unfortunately we were able to reach the same deal last May,” Naim said. President Joe Biden praised the deal in remarks on Wednesday afternoon, although at one point he mistakenly referred to Hamas as Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. “It’s a very good afternoon, because at long last I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas after more than 15 months of conflict that began with Hezbollah’s brutal massacre on October the 7th,” he said. During phase two, Biden added, negotiators will work toward “a permanent end to the war.” The agreement on Wednesday brought immediate relief and hope to Palestinians in Gaza who have been living in inhumane conditions, though celebrations were dimmed by continuous deadly airstrikes by Israeli forces. Families of the Israeli hostages who have agonized over the fate of their loved ones for more than a year also expressed mixed feelings and tentative optimism about the return of all the hostages. The families of American hostages held in Gaza said in a statement that they are “deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement” to release their loved ones and thanked Biden and President-elect Donald Trump for their efforts in landing a deal. “The coming days and weeks will be just as painful for our families as the entirety of our loved ones’ horrific ordeals,” they added. “That is why we ask all parties to stay committed to this agreement, every phase until it is fully implemented and everyone has been returned.” Israel and Hamas, who have been in conflict for decades, have engaged in a brutal war since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel subsequently launched an indiscriminate military campaign in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of people, destroying critical infrastructure and imposing a severe blockade of essential supplies and humanitarian aid into the Strip. Israel has repeatedly said that it is adhering to the rules of war and has taken all possible measures to limit harm to civilians, but investigations by human rights groups, humanitarian organizations and news outlets have found a pattern of disproportionate attacks by Israeli forces in Gaza. In December 2024, Amnesty International said it concluded that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, an accusation that the IDF has called “entirely baseless and fail to account for the operational realities faced by the IDF.” Amnesty International also determined that some of Hamas’ actions “constituted war crimes under international law.” Multiple previous rounds of ceasefire talks have fallen apart, save for a hostage exchange deal in November 2023 that saw a brief pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Name: Link, dtype: object","Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement to halt more than a year of fighting in the Gaza Strip, President Biden and Qatar's prime minister announced separately on Wednesday. The deal comes after a week of intense negotiations mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt. ""Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal,"" Mr. Biden said in a written statement. ""This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity."" Speaking from the White House Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden said, ""There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal, and I'm deeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel, and for the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war."" He said Americans will be among the hostages released in phase one of the deal, ""and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home."" The deal is expected to take effect Sunday, the White House said. As news of the agreement broke, crowds gathered in Deir al Bala in Gaza, and celebratory gunfire was heard. ""I'm extremely happy,"" one young Palestinian woman in the Gaza city of Khan Younis told CBS News. ""The past 15 months I experienced tears, laughters, lost martyrs and people went into prison, but finally I feel the joy."" ""I am very happy, and today is the day I wished to hear about since the beginning of the war,"" an elderly man said. ""God is sending us hope,"" he added. The ceasefire is not yet in effect, and Israeli airstrikes continued Wednesday in Gaza City and Khan Younis after the news broke. The families of the American hostages still being held in Gaza expressed their relief at the news of a deal. ""We are deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring our loved ones — Omer, Edan, Sagui, Itay, Keith, Gad, and Judi — home,"" the families said in a statement. ""We have been waiting for 467 days while our family members suffer from life-threatening injuries, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. We thank President Biden, President-elect Trump, and their teams for their constructive efforts to make this possible."" A draft of the deal had been agreed to in principle earlier in the week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News. It sets out a phased framework for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages still held by Hamas for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. It also includes access for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the eventual ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to areas they fled. Intense negotiations had been underway in Doha for the past few weeks, with President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, staying in the region for the better part of a month. McGurk has been closely coordinating with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Mr. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone on Sunday about the negotiations and again on Wednesday. A senior U.S. official described their latest conversation as ""a very warm call, marking this moment."" In Israel, families of the approximately 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 2023 attack, which saw the group and allied militants kill about 1,200 people, have been holding regular rallies demanding a negotiated deal for the release of their loved ones. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died. More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine. What is in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal? Details of the deal are similar to a plan outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The deal is expected to go into effect on Sunday. According to a draft from mediator sources, viewed by CBS News earlier this week, and Mr. Biden's description, it would consist of three phases, each lasting about 42 days. During the first phase, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said. The first phase will also include the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, Mr. Biden said. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older. A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released. On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died. During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems. The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday. The third phase would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said. Trump responds to ceasefire and hostage release deal In his remarks, Mr. Biden noted that the deal will largely be implemented after his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office. ""This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,"" the president said. ""For these past few days, we've been speaking as one team."" Trump posted on social media as news broke of the hostage and ceasefire agreement. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,"" Trump wrote. ""I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones."" Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel ""to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven."" ""We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,"" Trump wrote. ""Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!"" Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago estate Wednesday, with five days to go until he becomes president. Asked how much credit Trump should get for the deal, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns: ""I would hope we would all move beyond the question of who gets credit. I mean, I don't think that the hostages are caring about that, and I don't think their families care about that. I don't think the Palestinians in Gaza care about who gets credit for this. The truth is that there's a lot of credit to go around, including in the [Mideast] region."" Kirby said the Biden administration worked closely with their counterparts on Trump's team. ""It's important to remember that this deal was the deal that President Biden negotiated and put on the table back in May, got international support for it. That's the deal that we're talking about being implemented here,"" Kirby said. ""And it was due to a lot of intense diplomacy by American diplomats.""

Name: Link, dtype: object","First lady Jill Biden in an interview published Wednesday said she's disappointed with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reflecting on their decades-long relationship and the lawmaker's role at the end of President Joe Biden's reelection bid. Pelosi was a crucial player last summer in persuading President Biden to drop out of the race after his poor performance in a debate against now-President-elect Donald Trump. Jill Biden told the Washington Post that she has been ""thinking a lot about relationships"" as her family's time as the nation's first family comes to a close. “We were friends for 50 years.” the first lady told the outlet, speaking about Pelosi. “It was disappointing.” Democrats were plunged into chaos for weeks after the debate, split over whether Biden should bow out or remain the nominee. In a pivotal phone call, Pelosi told Biden that polls showed he would lose to Trump and risk bringing down the party's congressional prospects with him, USA TODAY reported in August. The former speaker last summer also appeared to question Biden's candidacy in public. When asked in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Biden still had her support to be the Democratic pick, she said “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.” Biden at the time insisted he was staying in the 2024 race for the White House and had already locked up the Democratic nomination. He ultimately dropped out on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Jill Biden also addressed a viral moment in December, when she and Trump were seated near each other at the reopening of the gothic masterpiece cathedral Notre-Dame in Paris. Photos from the event showed Trump and Jill Biden speaking to each other and smiling, an unexpected interaction between political foes. The first lady told the Washington Post that Trump admitted to her “I had a good meeting with your husband in the Oval Office.” She said she joked back that the rivals are ""both talkers."" Trump and Joe Biden met at the White House in November. They both spoke about the importance of a peaceful transition between their administrations. “Politics is tough, and it’s in many cases not a nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much,” Trump told Joe Biden during their meeting. The day after Trump and Jill Biden were pictured together at Notre Dame, Trump used a photo of the interaction in a promotion for his line of fragrances. Trump included the caption “A fragrance your enemies can’t resist"" in a post on Truth Social. When asked why she spoke with Trump at the event, Jill Biden told the Washington Post, “Joe and I respect our institutions, our traditions."" ""And it’s very important to me that they continue...

Name: Link, dtype: object","First lady Jill Biden is expressing her disappointment with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the longtime lawmaker’s widely reported role in persuading President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his reelection bid. The first lady touched on the subject in an exit interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday. “It’s been on my mind a lot lately,” Biden told the paper. “We were friends for 50 years. It was disappointing.” President Joe Biden performed disastrously in the June debate against his opponent, Republican then-nominee Donald Trump, and made several public missteps in the following weeks that prompted massive concern about his chances in the election within Democratic Party circles. Pelosi reportedly had pressured the president to reconsider his run before he ultimately announced his exit in July. She has declined to confirm many specifics, but in August admitted that she will need to “come to terms” with her “own role” in his choice. “Let’s just say I was disappointed with how it unfolded,” Jill Biden told the Post. “I learned a lot about human nature.” President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee, only for her to lose the election. Before November, Pelosi claimed Democrats had had an open primary of sorts, but after Harris’ loss, Pelosi argued that her candidacy would’ve been stronger if Biden had left sooner. “The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,” Pelosi told the New York Times after the presidential election, adding that Harris “would have done well in that and been stronger going forward.” President Biden told USA Today last week that he thinks he would’ve defeated Trump, had he decided to stay in the race. When asked whether he would’ve been fit enough to serve another four-year term, however, he said, “I don’t know. Who the hell knows?” His wife appeared slightly more confident. She told the Post, “Sure. I mean, today, I think he has a full schedule.

20,Minnesota House DFL files lawsuit saying Republicans speaker election ‘unlawful’,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/minnesota-house-dfl...
Name: Link, dtype: object","The debate over whether Minnesota House Republicans acted lawfully when they elected a speaker is headed to the state Supreme Court. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Secretary of State Steve Simon and the House DFL have filed lawsuits to stop Republicans from taking control of the House for the next two years, arguing it’s unconstitutional for them to move forward without Democrats present. The 67 House Republicans on Tuesday elected Rep. Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, as speaker with no DFLers present and continued to conduct business without Democrats on Wednesday. Simon, who as secretary of state initiates the first House proceedings, ruled there was not a quorum present and adjourned the session. Republicans argued he couldn’t do that. This year’s election gave the state a House tied 67-67, but the DFL is currently one seat down after a candidate was disqualified for not living in the district he ran to represent. Rep.-elect Curtis Johnson stepped down in late December after a court found there was enough evidence to show he didn’t live in the Roseville-area district where he claimed residency. Johnson defeated his GOP opponent by 30 points, so the House tie likely will return after a special election to fill that seat on Jan. 28. But Republicans are trying to use this window of opportunity to take control of committees and elect a speaker for the next two years. They also are suing over the timing of that special election. The state Supreme Court heard arguments in that case Wednesday, and a hearing for the quorum-related challenges was set for Jan. 23. To prevent that from happening, DFL representatives are currently boycotting the session. The sides had attempted to negotiate a power-sharing deal, but talks fell apart before the Legislature convened Tuesday. Democrats also are not showing up at the Capitol because Republicans have suggested they might not seat Shakopee DFL Rep. Brad Tabke even after a judge ruled he was eligible to take the District 54A seat despite 20 missing ballots in the race. In response to the DFL boycott, Republicans have threatened to file recall election petitions against representatives who don’t show up. DFLers say their absence denies the House the quorum of 68 members needed to conduct business, per their interpretation of the state Constitution. However, that is disputed by Republicans. They say a majority means a majority of elected members, 133, not total seats in the House, 134. DFLers had most of their members sworn in on Sunday at a closed ceremony, and they didn’t have to show up on the first day. Typically, members swear in at noon on the first day of session, something noted in the state Constitution, and Republicans decried the move as “illegitimate.” Rep. Melissa Hortman, leader of the DFL House Caucus, said the GOP’s actions on Tuesday were invalid. “Republicans’ sham session had no legal authority, and the actions they took on January 14 have no legal effect. A 68-member quorum is required to conduct House business, and only 67 members were present,” Hortman said. “Republicans are going to extreme and unprecedented lengths to seize power that the voters did not give them, and Democrats will fight their unlawful, unconstitutional actions every step of the way.” Demuth said in a statement that Republicans will continue House business as a majority. “Secretary Simon has no authority as a member of the executive branch over proceedings in the House, and his role is strictly ceremonial in nature,” Demuth said. “We look forward to defending the House from this attack on our Constitutional separation of powers, and to ensuring the Minnesota House continues its important work on behalf of Minnesotans who elected us to show up and do our jobs.” Politics |   Judge hears arguments in bid to delay Sen.

Name: Link, dtype: object","Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s nominee for the next U.S. attorney general, repeatedly refused to explicitly state that the president-elect lost the 2020 presidential election while she was grilled under oath during her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Bondi evaded a direct answer when asked by Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin whether she can say Trump lost in 2020. “President Biden is the president of the United States, he was duly sworn in, and he is the president of the United States,” she replied. She said Trump “left office and he was overwhelmingly elected in 2024” but suggested the 2020 results were fraudulent. “Do I accept the results? Of course I do,” she said. “No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issue with election integrity.” “I think that question deserved a yes or no,” Durbin replied. “I think the length of your question means you weren’t prepared to say yes.” Asked again by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, Bondi replied: “Joe Biden is the president of the United States.” Hirono said there is a difference between acknowledging who is president and who won. “You can’t say who won the 2020 election. It’s disturbing you can’t give voice to that fact,” she said. Bondi did not respond. Bondi joined then-Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in Pennsylvania just after Election Day in 2020 when she declared Trump “won” the state while there were still 1 million ballots left to be counted. She then went on Fox News to declare there was “evidence of cheating” and “fake ballots.” In another fierce round of questions, Democratic Senator Alex Padilla demanded to know whether she had any evidence. She refused to answer. “You cut me off when I was speaking,” she said. “I’m not going to be bullied by you. … I guess you don’t want to hear my answer.” Senator Adam Schiff — who was a House prosecutor during Trump’s first impeachment, when Bondi represented Trump — pressed her on whether she would investigate Jack Smith and former congresswoman Liz Cheney. “That’s a hypothetical,” she replied. “No, it’s not a hypothetical,” he said. “The president has called for this — you are aware of this, aren’t you?” He asked her if she has the “independence” and “intestinal fortitude” to admit Trump lost in 2020. “What I can tell you is I will never play politics,” she said. “You’re trying to get me in a gotcha.” Throughout her testimony, Bondi committed herself to the Constitution and to what she called “back to basics” work at the Department of Justice, striking at what she has called the partisan “weaponization” of the agency against perceived political enemies — echoing claims from Trump and his allies who have characterized the federal indictments of the former president as a politically motivated conspiracy. But she did not explicitly rule out prosecuting Trump’s targets after senators asked her to explain her statements that “prosecutors will be prosecuted” under his administration. Durbin said her experience and competence are not under scrutiny, but rather her ability “to say to the president of the United States, ‘you’re wrong.’” When asked whether she would ever drop a case if Trump commanded it, Bondi said she would not have accepted the nomination if she thought that would happen. She also claimed to have never heard Trump’s call demanding Georgia election officials “find” enough votes for his victory, nor did she claim to have known about Trump calling January 6 defendants “hostages” and “patriots.” Bondi also said she would “follow the law” when it comes to the appointment of special counsels — despite joining court briefings to argue that Jack Smith was illegally hired. The former Florida attorney general also repeatedly defended Kash Patel, Trump’s pick for FBI director, who has vowed to dismantle the agency and threatened to “come after” Trump’s perceived enemies. Asked if she would ever hire someone with an “enemies list,” what critics have called Patel’s self-described “members of the executive branch deep state,” she highlighted the accomplishments of the man who could run the federal law enforcement agency under her direction. “I’ll cut to the chase. You’re clearly talking about Kash Patel,” Bondi said. “I don’t believe he has an enemies list. … I know that Kash Patel has had 60 jury trials as a public defender, as a prosecutor, he has great intel experience … I have known Kash and I believe Kash is the right person, in the right time, for this job.” If she becomes attorney general, “you have to be able to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election” and “you have to be able to say that January 6 insurrectionists who committed violence shouldn’t be pardoned,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told her. “You have to be able to say that a nominee for FBI director who says he has an enemies list — and that’s just the beginning of what he has said in terms of politicizing, deeply weaponizing the FBI against political opponents — that he shouldn’t be FBI director,” he said. “No, I don’t,” Bondi fired back. “I sit up here and speak the truth. I’m not going to say anything I need to say to get confirmed by this body,” she said. “I will answer the questions to the best of my ability, honestly. … If confirmed, he will follow the law … and I don’t believe he would do anything otherwise.” If confirmed, Bondi could lead a radically reshaped Justice Department built around Trump’s legal team. Her deputy attorney general managing the agency’s day-to-day operations could be Trump’s criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche. His deputy could be his law partner Emil Bove, and the deputy handling the civil rights division could be Harmeet Dhillon, who led more than a dozen election challenges on behalf of the Trump campaign D. John Sauer — who argued for Trump’s “immunity” from criminal prosecution — was tapped for U.S. solicitor general. Will Scharf — who joined the legal team in Trump’s federal election interference case — was named White House staff secretary. Alina Habba, who defended Trump in E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case and in his fraud trial, was named counselor to the president."

The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the need for Polish families to bury their relatives with dignity. It had become a sticking point between the two neighbours amid Warsaw's support for Kiev in its now three-year war with Russia. During massacres in what is now western Ukraine between 1943 and 1945, Ukrainian nationalists murdered around 100,000 Poles. They aimed to reinforce claims to the territory through an uprising against the German Nazi occupiers and the elimination of the Polish population. Estimates suggest up to 20,000 Ukrainians were killed in retaliatory actions. Tusk told a news conference: ""We will solve the problem of commemorating the victims of the Volhynia massacres. I do not want anyone in Poland or Europe to make this a political condition for supporting Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia."" Zelensky added: ""Poland's support is very important to us. We must move forward in our relations, look ahead."" Zelensky also used the news conference to reiterate his support for the deployment of NATO troops as part of security guarantees following any peace agreement with Russia. ""We support the idea that a contingent from one country or another, our allies, our strategic partners, can become part of the security guarantees,"" he said. Zelensky has discussed the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron and the Baltic States. He will also talk with Britain, he added. The strength and location of any deployment is still to be clarified, with a ceasefire in Ukraine not yet on the horizon."

The comments add to warnings from military and intelligence agencies of an escalating Kremlin campaign of attacks aimed at destabilizing the continent. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such efforts. “I can only confirm this latest information — I won’t go into details — but confirm the validity of these fears, that Russia was also planning acts of air terror,” Tusk told reporters in Warsaw alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. “And not only toward Poland, but toward airlines around the world.” A Polish government spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Tusk’s accusation “nothing but groundless speculation.” Poland’s prime minister referred to a plan that would ultimately place incendiary devices on planes to North America through air cargo shipments, according to a senior government official who spoke under condition of anonymity. European and US intelligence officials warned that Russia may be behind the plot. In August, Poland arrested four people suspected of links to a sabotage group whose activities included sending parcels containing camouflaged explosives and dangerous materials via courier companies to countries in the European Union and the UK. Governments across Europe have been raising the alarm over the growing threat of Russia-sponsored acts of sabotage and destabilization since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. Incidents attributed to Moscow have escalated in the course of the last year to include arson, vandalism, the jamming of GPS signals and a foiled plot to assassinate the chief executive officer of a German arms company. Russian intelligence targeted several European countries with sabotage attacks, often by hiring local criminals, officials previously told Bloomberg News. Its cyber and disinformation operations have long focused on the US and Europe. --With assistance from Greg Sullivan.

Security officials have said that parcels that exploded at logistics depots in Europe were part of a test run for a Russian plot to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the United States. The explosions occurred in depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July. Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw alongside Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Donald Tusk said: “The latest information can confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of terrorism in the air not only against Poland.” He did not say what acts he was referring to or elaborate on the contents of the information. The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. Azerbaijan has also accused Russia of unintentionally shooting down an Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas day, killing 38 people. Mr Putin apologised for what he called a “tragic incident” following the crash but stopped short of acknowledging that Moscow was responsible. The pro-European Union government in Warsaw said that Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland’s neighbour Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The Russian embassy in Warsaw and the Russian foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment on Mr Tusk’s statement. Elsewhere during the conference, Mr Tusk vowed to use his country’s presidency of the EU to push forward with Ukraine’s membership quest. Poland now holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, the 27-member bloc that Ukraine aspires to join, and Warsaw will have the influence to put the issue high on the agenda for the next half year. It comes as Russia launched a major ballistic and cruise missile attack across Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure and compelling authorities to shut down the power grid.  Mr Zelensky said that the Russian forces launched over 40 missiles during the morning attack and used more than 70 drones overnight, in a new barrage against the struggling power system in the depths of winter. The Russian defence ministry confirmed it launched a strike on “critically important facilities of gas and energy infrastructure that ensure the functioning of Ukraine’s military-industrial complex”. It didn’t give the target locations or other details. The barrage came a day after the Russian defence ministry vowed a response to what it said was an attack on Russian soil using multiple Western-supplied missiles. The capital Kyiv also came under attack, with hundreds of residents taking shelter in underground metro stations across the capital, sleeping on yoga mats and sitting on folded chairs with their pets. The governor of Ukraine’s western Lviv region said two energy facilities, in the Drohobych and Stryi districts, were damaged. In neighbouring Ivano-Frankivsk, the governor said air defences were fending off Russian attacks on facilities. Russia has stepped up its bombardments of Ukraine’s power sector and other energy infrastructure since March 2024, knocking out half of the available generating capacity and forcing long, rolling blackouts across the country. Russia and Ukraine exchanged 25 prisoners of war each after negotiations mediated by the United Arab Emirates. Mr Zelensky thanked the UAE, which has brokered similar swaps before, for its assistance “in making today’s event possible”. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report"

By lowering the threshold for passage in the Senate from 60 votes to 51, reconciliation allows the party controlling Congress and the White House to pass broad policy changes — provided they deal with budgetary and other fiscal matters. The sources told Fox News Digital Miller's portion of the meeting partly focused on what border and immigration policies could go into a reconciliation package and what kind of funding Congress would need to appropriate.  1.4 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN US HAVE BEEN ORDERED DEPORTED, BUT HAVE YET TO BE REMOVED: OFFICIAL The sources said Miller told Republicans the incoming Trump administration understood the president-elect's border and immigration goals were ""probably not going to get a lot"" of Democratic votes and that ""those more controversial things would need to be in reconciliation."" More bipartisan initiatives could be passed during the regular process, the sources added.  A House GOP lawmaker told Fox News Digital of an understanding that Congress would follow Trump's lead. ""I think we're going to see a slew of executive orders early, and that is going to be helpful to separate from what we have to do legislatively,"" the lawmaker said. One source in the room said Miller emphasized the importance of messaging, adding that ""nothing matters if we don't get our message out to the American people."" President-elect Trump has promised to carry out mass deportations. (Donald Trump/Truth Social) Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital Miller discussed ""low-hanging fruit"" that Trump could tackle by executive order, mentioning ""deportation"" as a possibility. ""Tax stuff, that's going to take some time,"" Norman said. Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., declined to go into specifics about the meeting but told Fox News Digital the discussion focused on ""illegal immigration and how that's going to be curbed … to bring commonsense solutions to the program."" HOUSE DOGE CAUCUS EYES FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN NEW GOAL-SETTING MEMO ""I had a couple of questions about the cost to American taxpayers if we don't repatriate some 12 million illegal aliens who the Biden administration has let into our country,"" Alford said. Miller declined to answer reporters' questions when he left the room. He was invited to address the Republican Study Committee led by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the House GOP's largest caucus, which acts as a conservative think tank of sorts for the rest of the House Republican Conference.  Pfluger told Fox News Digital in a statement after the meeting, ""The Republican Study Committee is in lockstep with the incoming Trump administration. We are committed to working around the clock to deliver on the promises we made to the American people, especially when it comes to securing our border and enforcing immigration policies."" ""We will continue to work with Stephen Miller and his team to deliver the legislative victories they need from the House."" House GOP leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were not in attendance, nor were they expected. Rep. Mark Alford said he asked about the cost to taxpayers to keep millions of illegal immigrants in the country. (Getty Images) Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., the group's previous chairman, said there was ""nothing new"" said during the meeting, adding it was an opportunity for Trump's aides to address the House GOP.

29,Takeaways from the second day of Trump Cabinet confirmation hearings,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/takeaways-second-da...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees for key roles in the intelligence, foreign policy and law enforcement agencies all pledged to keep politics out of their offices amid concerns from Democrats that the president-elect will carry out his vows to go after his political enemies once in office. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, repeatedly insisted she would not allow politics to infect her Justice Department – accusing President Joe Biden’s DOJ of being responsible for politicizing law enforcement against Trump. “Every case will be prosecuted based on the facts and the law that’s applied in good faith, period. Politics have got to be taken out of the system,” Bondi said before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “This department has been weaponized for years and years and years, and it has to stop.” In addition to Bondi’s pledge not to be influenced by politics, Trump’s nominee for CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said he would not impose “political litmus tests” at the agency, while secretary of state nominee and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, defended the importance of NATO, an alliance Trump has often questioned. The confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks kicked off Tuesday with a highly contentious session for defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth. On Wednesday, the slate of a half-dozen hearings struck a much more conciliatory tone, where the concerns raised by senators were about the conduct of the president-elect and not the nominees themselves. There were still heated moments Wednesday, particularly with Bondi and questions about claims of 2020 election fraud and Trump’s calls for jailing his enemies including special counsel Jack Smith and former Rep. Liz Cheney. “I’m not going to be bullied by you,” Bondi declared during a testify back-and-forth with Sen. Alex Padilla of California. But Democratic senators made clear they were not going to blanketly oppose all of Trump’s nominees, particularly Rubio, a fellow senator. On Wednesday, Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado introduced Trump’s energy secretary nominee, fracking CEO Chris Wright, who is also from Colorado. There are still more contentious hearings looming, including Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; his pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and for FBI director, Kash Patel – who was invoked by Democrats multiple times during Bondi’s hearing. Here are the takeaways from Wednesday’s slate of confirmation hearings: Democrats repeatedly pressed Bondi on Wednesday about her ability to stand up to Trump, who has said he has an “absolute right” to be involved in Justice Department matters and clashed with his attorneys general in his first administration when they did not bend to his wishes. “I need to know that you would tell the president ‘no’ if you are asked to do something that is wrong, illegal or unconstitutional,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat. Bondi responded by blasting the “weaponization” of the Biden Justice Department and said that she would not improperly target people with criminal probes like those against Trump. “I will not politicize that office,” Bondi said of being attorney general. “I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation.” Bondi also vowed Wednesday to follow the Justice Department’s policy to limit contacts between the White House and the Justice Department. “I believe this Justice Department must be independent and must act independently,” she said. Pressed on whether she would investigate officials Trump has suggested should be jailed – including special counsel Jack Smith and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney – Bondi said “no one would be pre-judged.” Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii questioned Bondi over comments she made during the 2024 election cycle that “bad” prosecutors should be held criminally responsible. “Sometimes ‘bad’ is in the eye of the beholder. I am just asking whether you would consider Jack Smith to be one of the people,” Hirono said. “How about Liz Cheney? How about Merrick Garland?” “Senator, I am not going into hypotheticals,” Bondi responded. “No one has been pre-judged, nor will anyone be pre-judged if I am confirmed.” Later, Bondi clashed with Sen. Adam Schiff of California – another of Trump’s longtime targets – over whether her personal political beliefs would affect decisions on January 6 pardons and the preservation of evidence from the special counsel investigations into Trump. At one point in the exchange, Bondi raised the House’s Republican-led censure of Schiff in 2023, while he pressed her on whether there was evidence to start an investigation into Smith. “It would be irresponsible of me to make a commitment regarding anything,” Bondi said. “What I’m hearing on the news is horrible. Do I know if he committed a crime? I have not looked at it.” Bondi was questioned about whether she accepts that Biden won the 2020 election – a fact that Trump continues to falsely dispute after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday she accepts that Trump lost the 2020 election but falsely claimed “there was a peaceful transition of power” that year, ignoring the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that disrupted the election certification. “President Biden is the president of the United States,” Bondi said. “He was duly sworn in, and he is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024.” She also sowed doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 results, citing her on-the-ground legal work that year for the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania. Trump has falsely claimed there was massive fraud in the state, and dispatched Bondi and other allies like Rudy Giuliani to try to overturn the results there. “I accept the results. I accept, of course, that Joe Biden is President of the United States,” she said. “But what I can tell you is what I saw firsthand when I went to Pennsylvania as an advocate for the (2020) campaign… I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened? I saw so much.” Bondi was also questioned about pardons for those convicted of crimes related to January 6, as Trump has suggested he will do in some cases once in office. Asked whether she believes “violent assaults on police officers should be pardoned,” Bondi said that she would advise the president as her job requires. “The pardons, of course, fall under the president,” Bondi said. “But if asked to look at those cases, I will look at each case and advise on a case-by-case basis, just as I did my entire career as a prosecutor.” Several Democrats asked Bondi to respond to comments that Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has made about prosecuting the president-elect’s enemies. Bondi defended Patel’s credentials, while suggesting at several points that senators should pose their questions to him when he testified before the panel. Still, Bondi was clear when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island pressed her on Patel’s comments about going after the president’s enemies. “There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,” Bondi said. Rubio, who has served as a senator for more than a decade, may have received the warmest reception from his colleagues when he appeared on the other side of the dais Wednesday as Trump’s nominee to lead the State Department. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Rubio “has the skills” and is “well-qualified to serve as secretary of state.” “I believe this committee has a responsibility to get your team out to the field and we hope you will send us qualified, experienced, and well-vetted nominees to consider,” she said, noting the need to confirm career diplomats. During questions from senators, Rubio voiced his support for NATO – as well as the bipartisan law he co-sponsored, which states that the US cannot withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval or an act of Congress. “I was a co-sponsor of the law, and so it’s tough to say I’m not in support of a law that I helped to pass and that I think it’s an important role for Congress to play,” Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In response to questions about Russia’s war against Ukraine, Rubio said it’s “unrealistic to believe” Ukraine can push Russian forces back to where they were before the 2022 invasion and that the official US position should be that the war should end. Rubio added he and Trump agree about the war needing to come to an end and criticized the Biden administration for not setting a clear “end goal” for the war. “What Vladimir Putin has done is unacceptable, there’s no doubt about it, but this war has to end, and I think it should be the official policy of the United States that we want to see it end,” Rubio said. While Rubio was testifying, the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced, which committee chairman Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho announced to the hearing room. Rubio credited both the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff for the agreement. “I dare to say that all involved deserve credit for the ceasefire that the chairman has just announced,” Rubio told senators. “Before we all celebrate, though, obviously, we’re all going to want to see how that executes,” Risch cautioned. Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe pledged not to politicize his work and the intelligence that’s produced in the Trump administration. He told the committee he would never allow “political or personal biases to cloud our judgement or infect our products.” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, urged Ratcliffe to reassure rank-and-file intelligence officials that they “need not fear reprisal for speaking truth to power.” The Virginia Democrat expressed concerns about the attacks that some Trump loyalists have made against the intelligence community, asking Ratcliffe to commit not to fire or force out CIA employees because of their political views. “If you are asked to remove personnel, to get rid of individuals based upon this kind of political litmus test, I’d ask that you keep the committee informed of those, those requests,” Warner said to Ratcliffe. “I certainly will,” Ratcliffe said. “I think my record in terms of speaking truth to power and defending the intelligence community and its good work is very clear,” Ratcliffe added. Across the Capitol complex, several additional Trump Cabinet picks testified ahead of the president-elect’s inauguration next week. During tense questioning on climate change by a California senator, Trump energy pick Chris Wright said he stood by past social media comments that “the hype over wildfires is just hype” to justify climate policies he views as detrimental. Padilla, whose state is currently battling massive wildfires in Los Angeles, asked Wright if he stood by those comments in light of the current deadly and devastating fires. “I stand by my past comments,” Wright said. “Tell that to the families of the more than two-dozen people” who lost their lives, Padilla shot back. Wright later said the fires were “horrific.” Wright, a fracking CEO in Colorado, vowed in his testimony to “unleash American energy” – echoing a talking point Trump often repeated on the campaign trail. Wright said the US should increase energy production, including liquified natural gas and commercial nuclear energy. In another committee room, Trump’s nominee to head up the Office of Management and Budget would not commit Wednesday to releasing billions of remaining dollars approved for Ukraine funding — an early sign of contention between Congress and the incoming administration. Russell Vought, who also served in the powerful budget role during the first Trump administration, said he wouldn’t presuppose the incoming president’s intentions on the matter. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president on a foreign policy issue,” he said. His answer suggested the new administration would make use of the practice known as impoundment, which allows the president to decline to spend money Congress has already appropriated. There is more than $3 billion in approved Ukraine aid remaining that it will fall to Trump to spend when he takes office. And Trump’s nominee for transportation secretary, former Rep. Sean Duffy, discussed troubles with plane manufacturer Boeing, whether he would support more funding for Amtrak, and transparency on the mysterious drones over New Jersey at his hearing Wednesday. Testifying before the Commerce Committee, Duffy, a recent Fox Business co-host and former Wisconsin lawmaker, told committee members that a priority for him would be restoring “global confidence in Boeing.” The plane maker has had a string of incidents in recent years but said it has made strides to change operations and safety-related incidents. “Boeing is a national security issue,” Duffy told the committee. “Boeing is the largest exporter of American product, incredibly important, as in one of my meetings, someone said, though, ‘they need tough love,’ which is what they do need.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

30,Trump credited for ceasefire breakthrough as US officials who resigned over Gaza...,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-credited-ceas...
Name: Link, dtype: object","U.S. officials who resigned over the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza slammed the outgoing president for failing to broker a ceasefire sooner, after President-elect Donald Trump played a key role in securing an end to the devastating 15-month conflict. “This is a deal that, in its basic form, has been on the table for many months, and it is an absolute travesty that the Biden administration never used any of the massive leverage it had to push it over the finish line,” Josh Paul, who resigned from the State Department’s in opposition to America’s policy of providing lethal arms to Israel for use in Gaza, said. The agreement “demonstrates clearly that Biden could have achieved a ceasefire all along if his people were really serious about it,” Annelle Sheline, who resigned from the State Department in February 2024, told The Independent. The historic ceasefire was announced Wednesday after 466 days of fighting in the Middle East — with the multi-phase planning including the gradual return of all hostages taken in the October 7 attacks, and a full withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. Reports from diplomats involved in the negotiations reveal that Trump played a key role in brokering the agreement by piling pressure on the Israeli government to accept the deal — something President Biden had been unable or unwilling to do, much to the frustration of his former officials. “It’s not as if suddenly the terms have shifted significantly, it’s just that now you had an incoming US president that was willing to actually use some pressure,” Sheline, who resigned from the Biden administration over the president’s refusal to lean on the Israeli government to prevent more bloodshed in Gaza, said. Tariq Habash, the first administration appointee to resign in protest over the war, also pointed the finger at Biden, calling it “a failure of the Biden administration that it took so long for us to get to this point.” “I don’t think that the Biden administration was prioritizing reaching a deal expediently,” Habash, a Palestinian-American political appointee at the Department of Education, said. “I think that if they wanted to, they would have leveraged some real influence, particularly with [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and the Israeli government, and I think that Biden and his advisors made a decision that that was not something that they’re willing to do that allowed for the continuation of the violence against Palestinian civilians for over 15 months,” Habash added. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Monday that Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff heaped pressure on Netanyahu to accept a deal that he had rejected numerous times over the past year. The paper described “a change in the rules of the game that has broken the deadlock in the hostage negotiations.” Paul, who left the State Department’s Bureau of Political Military Affairs in the first month of the war, told The Independent it was “clear” that Trump’s team played a role in brokering the agreement. “How much of that was commission as opposed to Netanyahu’s desire to give Trump a ‘win’ - a desire that has probably been a consideration for him since very early in this conflict - remains to be known,” he said. The outgoing Biden administration took the unusual step of letting Trump’s team take a lead role in negotiations, Haaretz reported. The Washington Post also cited a diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations crediting the influence of Trump’s team, saying it was “the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.” Biden made only a passing remark about the involvement of Trump’s team when announcing the deal. “This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,” he said.  “In these past few days, we have been speaking as one team.” When asked by a reporter who takes credit for the deal, him or Trump, Biden replied: “Is that a joke?” Biden could have achieved a ceasefire all along if his people were really serious about it Annelle Sheline, who left her role at the U.S. State Department over the president’s lack of pressure on Israel Shortly after the news broke, Trump posted on Truth Social: “We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you!” While the former officials celebrated the proposed pause in fighting, Sheline said she believed Trump’s interest in forging peace may not last beyond his inauguration. “Unfortunately, I think that Trump just wants this for his inauguration. It will be a temporary reprieve. That is to be celebrated, but I expect that Israel will resume its genocidal campaign of violence as soon as the inauguration is over and Trump has been able to say ‘I did what Biden couldn’t,’” she said. She added that it was in Netanyahu’s interests to give Trump a win because he has long-term plans for other parts of the Palestinian territories that will require Trump’s support. “There is likely an understanding that Trump will help him get what he wants, that being the annexation of the West Bank,” she said. Paul, too, expressed caution. “As important as a ceasefire is, what is even more important is what comes next: not only must the ceasefire be maintained, but there must be a real effort, backed by an international commitment, to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza, to pursue justice and accountability on behalf of all who have suffered since and before October 2023, to begin rebuilding the lost cities and towns of Gaza, and to achieve a just and lasting peace,” he said. Habash said his initial reaction was that the deal was “great news” and urged more action. “We should all be celebrating the end to violence that continues to perpetuate the unequal treatment of all people,” he said. “And I think if there is a deal that can both stop the killing of Palestinian civilians, stop the starvation, and also return hostages, both Palestinian and Israeli, I think that is extremely important in a step towards lasting peace.”"
31,Trump Family and Friends Don’t Like Don Jr.’s New Girlfriend,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-fami...
Name: Link, dtype: object","President-elect Donald Trump isn’t convinced Florida socialite Bettina Anderson is a good fit for Donald Trump Jr. following his split from MAGA “mamacita” Kimberly Guilfoyle. Sources told Mediaite that the president-elect and his advisers worry Anderson’s partying ways could hurt Don Jr. “Individuals close to the president have expressed growing concerns about the potential liability posed by his son’s new relationship,” a Trump family friend told Mediaite on Monday. The family friend added, “I told him that she’s not someone he should be around, and let him know about her past.” Don Jr. was allegedly warned that Anderson has a history of parading around with wealthy men in Palm Beach, but Anderson’s camp has denied such claims, according to Mediaite. “Donald Trump does not approve of his son’s association with Bettina,” another “close family friend” claimed. “Bettina’s presence is seen as a liability rather than an asset.” Anderson was seated behind Don Jr. and Guilfoyle, among other Trump family members, at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The comments from family sources seem to be a far cry from what the president-elect has openly said about Guilfoyle, who actively worked publicly and privately as MAGA’s mouthpiece in fundraising. Now that Guilfoyle has been booted from Don Jr.’s orbit with a plush ambassadorship post in Greece, pending Senate confirmation, sources close to the Trump family clan are hinting at some buyer’s remorse. If Don Jr. brings Anderson as his date to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, it could permanently tie her to the first family in the public’s eye. “The idea that he might have the audacity to bring a casual partner on stage at the inauguration has been described as a potential misstep that could etch this relationship, and its questionable nature, into the history books,” said the family friend."
32,Trump takes full credit for ‘EPIC’ ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-takes-full-cr...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Donald Trump claimed full credit on Wednesday for the “EPIC” ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The president-elect argued in a Truth Social post that the agreement, expected to be formally confirmed later Wednesday, “could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November.” “It signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump continued. “I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.” The agreement came after Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend. Trump thanked Witkoff in his post and vowed that going forward, the U.S. will ensure “Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven,” and that Israel keeps expanding the Abraham Accords normalization agreements with its neighbors established during the first Trump administration. The outgoing Biden administration described working tightly with the Trump team to seal the deal. Earlier this week, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the administration had “coordinated very closely” with the incoming Trump team to “present a united message to all the parties, which says it is in the American national security interest — regardless of party, regardless of outgoing or incoming administration” to “get this deal done as fast as possible.” Asked about Trump’s boasts and claims to be responsible for the deal, Biden pointed out that the agreement largely follows the framework he proposed last May. He credited American support for Israel with having helped to “badly weaken Hamas and its backers and create the conditions for this deal,” and stressed that he’d known all along that the deal would have to be implemented by Trump and his team. “So I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we’re all speaking with the same voice,” he said. “Because that’s what American presidents do.” The ceasefire deal, those close to negotiations told The Independent, will involve a phased series of steps, with Hamas releasing 33 of the roughly 100 hostages inside Gaza during an initial 42-day period. It is still unclear if the agreement will permanently end the conflict in Gaza, which has killed more than 1,000 Israelis and 46,000 Palestinians since Hamas’s 2023 invasion of Israel and has been declared a genocide by some international observers. Questions remain over whether Israeli troops will fully withdraw from Gaza, as well as whether Hamas will remain in power there in the future, a scenario Israel has rejected thus far. On the campaign trail, Trump took a variety of stances on the 15-month conflict. He positioned himself as a savior for Israel, claiming during a September speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas that the country would be “gone” if Kamala Harris were elected president. Trump also frequently demonized Jews who maintained their traditional support for Democrats, claiming they needed to have their “head examined.” At the same time, Trump agreed with protesters accusing Biden of being “Genocide Joe” for his continued support of Israel despite atrocities in Gaza, echoing a common sentiment on the left. And the Republican had criticisms for Netanyahu too, telling a radio host in April that the war needed to end. “You’ve got to get it over with, and you have to get back to normalcy,” Trump said in an interview with The Hugh Hewitt Show. During his first term in office, Trump backed multiple steps seen as favoring Netanyahu’s priorities in the larger Israel-Palestine conflict, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing contested Israeli sovereignty claims over the Golan Heights. Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank, considered illegal by the International Court of Justice, also boomed during the first Trump administration. Jewish settlers in the West Bank celebrated Trump’s victory in November. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler, has said he will make sure the Israeli government lobbies Trump on extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank."
33,Trump's AG pick Pam Bondi tells Senate 'There will never be an enemies list' in...,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-ag-pick-pam-...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Jan. 15 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, vowed to remain independent and nonpartisan during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday. Bondi did not distance herself from disproven claims about the 2020 election or rebuke the rhetoric of some of her fellow Cabinet nominees, however. Instead, she talked around some questions on those subjects while embracing the notion that the Department of Justice has been politically weaponized. The differing interests of Republicans and Democrats were on display throughout the hearing. Republicans remained concerned about the alleged political weaponization and lost trust in the Department of Justice under the Biden administration. Democrats were particularly interested in Bondi's ability to say ""no"" to Trump if asked to do something illegal or unconstitutional. Bondi reiterated that she will be the ultimate decision maker that will dictate the Justice Department's actions. Democrats remained skeptical about Bondi's close relationship to Trump. She has served as a legal adviser to the president-elect, campaigned on his behalf and advocated for him as he challenged the results of the 2020 election. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it ""ridiculous"" that Bondi's relationship with Trump is of any concern, adding that President John. F. Kennedy chose his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, as his attorney general. ""This idea there's something bad is ridiculous,"" Graham said. ""Who do you pick? You pick people you know. You pick people you trust and pick people who are qualified. The idea that there's something wrong with that is absolutely ridiculous."" While Bondi's qualifications and character were the focal point of the hearing, the character of another nominee, Kash Patel, was brought into question, as well. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Bondi if she would adopt Patel's ""enemies list"" that he has discussed at length across multiple public statements. Bondi supported Patel's nomination for FBI director but pushed back on the existence of an enemies list. ""I don't believe he has an enemies list. He made a quote on TV which I have not heard,"" Bondi responded. ""He has great experience in the intel department. I believe that Kash is the right person at this time for this job."" ""There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,"" she added. If both are confirmed, Patel would be under Bondi's purview. Some of Bondi's responses have been repeated throughout the hearing. When asked to weigh in on comments by Trump or Patel, she has deflected by saying she is ""not familiar"" with those statements. When asked who won the 2020 election, she has responded ""Joe Biden is the president."" Republicans have focused on the alleged political weaponization of the Department of Justice under the Biden administration. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, exclaimed that he does not want a Republican or Democratic Department of Justice. ""I want a Department of Justice that follows the damn law,"" Cruz said as he pounded his desk. Cruz is one of several Republican senators who have expressed their belief that the Biden administration's Justice Department has targeted political opponents, namely Trump. During his opening statement, committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, lauded Bondi for her experience and her work combatting the opioid epidemic and human trafficking while she was Florida's attorney general. He and the lawmakers who introduced Bondi -- Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. -- meanwhile called on Bondi to restore trust in the Justice Department, citing weaponization under the Biden administration. ""The Justice Department is infected with political decision-making while its leaders refuse to recognize that reality,"" Grassley said. ""I know, as other people on this committee and in and out of Congress know, what government weaponization is."" Bondi echoed the criticisms of the current Justice Department. ""I will fight everyday to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,"" she said. ""Partisanship will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all."" Bondi, a private practice lawyer, was the attorney general of Florida from 2011 to 2019. She has also served as an adviser to Trump during his first impeachment trial in 2019. Bondi has also parroted Trump's false claims that the 2020 election results were fraudulent. Ranking Democrat Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois asked Bondi if she accepts that President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory was legitimate. She said she accepts the result but raised questions about election integrity. She did not provide a straight answer. She did take the opportunity, while responding on multiple occasions, to highlight Trump's 2024 victory. Bondi went on to say she did not listen to the audio recording of Trump's phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. During this call, Trump asked Raffensperger to ""find"" the votes he needed to overturn the results of the election. Bondi claimed this is not what Trump was asking, despite saying she has not listened to the call in full. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., encouraged Bondi to listen to the recording. Bondi did not directly say whether or not she would support Trump's plan to pardon the Capitol rioters who have been charged or convicted for participating in the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ""I have not seen any of those files,"" she said. ""If confirmed and asked to advise, I will look at each file. I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country."" Several Republican senators indicated that they do not believe she or Trump would pardon violent offenders from the Capitol riot. The hearing became tense during Bondi's exchanges with Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, both of California. Both asked her to answer whether she had evidence of mass fraud in the 2020 election or if she would walk back statements that Trump won Pennsylvania in that election. She did not answer either question. ""You cut me off when I was speaking,"" Bondi said during a back-and-forth with Padilla. ""I'm not going to be bullied by you, Sen. Padilla."" Padilla would go on to ask Bondi if she recognized the 14th Amendment, referring to birthright citizenship, as the law of the land. Their exchange was again marked with crosstalk between the two, culminating in Bondi saying ""I'm not here to do your homework and study for you."" ""You're asking to serve as the attorney general of the United States and you still need to study the 14th Amendment of the Constitution?"" Padilla said.

34,Trump-fuelled stock market rally sends Wall Street profits to record highs,"0    https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-fuelled-s...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Wall Street’s biggest banks posted record profits after Donald Trump’s election triumph triggered a US stock market trading frenzy. JP Morgan reported a $58.5bn biggest annual profit on Wednesday, the largest in US banking history and beating its previous record of $49.6bn in 2023. Goldman Sachs’s annual profits also rose by 68pc to $14.3bn after a boom in clients ploughing into the US stock market following Mr Trump’s election victory in November. The record-breaking figures were driven by strong trading activity in the final three months of 2024, when uncertainty over the US Presidential election and then Mr Trump’s win sent the US stock market haywire. US stocks rallied after Nov 4 with the S&P 500 hitting a record high and delivering gains for the banks. JP Morgan, led by Jamie Dimon, veteran chief executive, posted a $14bn profit for the three months ending December, a 50pc jump compared with the same period year earlier. Goldman’s profits for the period covering Mr Trump’s election win also more than doubled to $4.1bn. Both banking giants are a bellwether for confidence in the US economy. The president-elect’s plans to deregulate financial markets and lower corporate taxes have fuelled optimism on Wall Street. Banking regulations such as Basel III, which tell Wall Street how much capital they need to hold, are expected to be softened significantly when Mr Trump takes power. David Solomon, Goldman Sachs chief executive, said issues that the new Trump administration were talking about had got people “excited”. “There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,” he said. “Additionally, there is … an overall increased appetite for dealmaking, supported by an improving regulatory backdrop.” Mr Dimon was also upbeat. “Businesses are more optimistic about the economy and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,” he said. Both banks also make a significant sum of money from mergers, and their investment banking businesses also showed a surge in activity. JP Morgan’s investment bank quarterly revenue rose 46pc versus the prior year to $2.6bn. Goldman’s investment bank revenues was $2bn – up 24pc from a year ago. Both banks advised on a number of UK deals, including Aviva’s takeover of Direct Line and BHP’s failed £34bn merger bid with Anglo American. The figures both bode well for Goldman and JP Morgan’s bonuses. Both banks are expected to unveil how much their bankers are paid in an announcement to staff next week.

35,UK and France in talks over sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/uk-france-talks-ove...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are discussing sending British and French soldiers to Ukraine as a peacekeeping force after any potential deal to end the war, The Telegraph understands. The French president is championing the idea and has already talked about it with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, and Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister. Press spokesmen for Downing Street and the Elysee Palace did not dispute that Sir Keir and Mr Macron discussed the possibility during their meeting at Chequers last week. Details of the conversations are being kept under wraps by officials in London and Paris. However, multiple well-placed UK government sources have stressed Sir Keir is not yet fully signed up. One Whitehall source told The Telegraph: “There are challenges over what we could support, what would we want to support, and the broader question about the threat that those troops may be under and whether that is escalatory.” The proposal comes as European leaders scramble to work out how to continue supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty as president-elect Donald Trump pushes for Kyiv to strike a peace deal with Russia. Mr Trump enters the White House on Monday. He has rowed back on his campaign promise to end the conflict on “day one” as US president but aims to do so in the first six months of his administration. Sir Keir has long been expected to visit Ukraine in the early new year, in what would be seen as a symbolic show of support for Mr Zelensky as US backing wavers. Publicly, the UK Government’s position is that Western allies should give Mr Zelensky as much support as possible, with the Ukrainians deciding when and if to hold peace talks. In private, ministers and officials are expecting Mr Trump to force Ukraine and Russia to get around the negotiating table, with attempts now underway to map out what would happen next. One idea now increasingly being talked about, not just in public debate but behind closed doors in Westminster, is whether Western troops may need to guarantee any peace terms. The thinking revolves around the idea that Russia could keep Ukrainian land it has captured as part of a peace deal – though much uncertainty about that prospect remains. Should that happen, European leaders have been thinking about what can be done to make sure the remaining territory of Ukraine is protected from any future Russian attacks. The challenge is that Mr Trump’s past criticism of deploying soldiers abroad, and his political attacks on financial support for Ukraine, mean it is unlikely US troops would take part. Multiple UK officials have come to this conclusion. One US-floated idea is that Western soldiers could man an 800-mile border between the new Ukrainian and Russian borders, with a demilitarised “buffer” zone established. Mr Macron is pushing the idea that European allies could be deployed on the ground to play such a role. Some of his discussions with other leaders have become public. The French president and Mr Tusk discussed the proposal in mid-December. Mr Tusk played down the idea at the time, saying Warsaw was not “planning any such actions”. Mr Macron and Mr Zelensky also talked about the potential plans on Monday. The Ukrainian president wrote on X: “[We] agreed to work closely with key allies on achieving peace and developing effective security guarantees. “As one such guarantee, we discussed the French initiative to deploy military contingents in Ukraine. We addressed practical steps for its implementation, potential expansion, and the involvement of other nations in this effort.” British officials have stressed they are yet to fully endorse the proposal. One Government source told The Telegraph: “We are getting slightly ahead of ourselves. We are not there yet.” However, that the discussions are happening shows the degree to which Downing Street is determined to keep supporting Ukraine, even after Mr Trump takes office. Any commitment of troops, should it happen, would put significant new pressure on the Ministry of Defence’s budget at a time when the Treasury is looking for spending cuts. In the spring Sir Keir will unveil his timeline for increasing UK defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product a year, up from around 2.3 per cent, but it remains unclear if the level can be reached before 2030. A deployment could involve thousands of British troops at a time when military leaders have already warned that the UK does not have the capacity to fight a war. It would also risk being seen as an escalation by Russia – a framing Downing Street has always rejected. Successive prime ministers have resisted announcing that British soldiers will be deployed in Ukraine ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Ukraine is not part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), which has a rule that an attack on one member is an attack on all, though the UK wants it to join one day. Questions about whether a no-fly zone would be established over the new Ukrainian land mass, and how it could be enforced, would also be sure to be raised. Boris Johnson, the former Tory prime minister, has expressed interest in the West putting boots on the ground in Ukraine as a peacekeeping force. Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory foreign secretary, and two former defence secretaries – Grant Shapps and Sir Gavin Williamson – have also publicly backed the idea. A UK Government spokesman said: “The UK is taking a leading role in supporting Ukraine, which is why the Prime Minister committed £3 billion a year of military support for Ukraine for as long as it takes, and this year the UK will spend more than it ever has on military funding for Ukraine. “Our focus remains on bolstering Ukraine’s defence, and we continue to push international partners to ramp up their financial support to Ukraine to ensure Putin loses. “The Prime Minister has also made a clear commitment to speak regularly with President Zelensky, and have met in person six times, including hosting him at No 10 twice.” A spokesman for the Elysee Palace declined to comment.

36,"Ukraine and Poland finding 'common language' on WW2 dispute, says Tusk","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraines-zelenskiy-...
Name: Link, dtype: object","By Barbara Erling, Yuliia Dysa and Jan Strupczewski WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland on Tuesday hailed progress in resolving a historical dispute with Ukraine and said Warsaw would work to speed its neighbour's progress towards the European Union in talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy which also covered arms supplies. Although EU-member Poland has been one of Ukraine's staunchest backers since Russia invaded in 2022, ties between the neighbours have been strained for generations by the Volhynia killings that took place from 1943 to 1945. The issue has become even more heated in recent years and will feature in the campaign for a presidential election in May, in which the main nationalist opposition candidate is the head of the National Remembrance Institute (IPN). Deputy Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in October that Ukraine would have to resolve it in order to join the European Union. ""We are finding a common language when it comes to the issue of the Volhynia crime,"" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a joint news conference with Zelenskiy. ""We will work towards a systemic solution to this problem"". Zelenskiy said that the allies must ""move forward in our relations"". On Friday, Tusk had hailed a ""breakthrough"" in ties, saying that Ukraine had made a decision to allow the first exhumations of victims to take place. Polish daily Rzeczpospolita reported that work on exhumations was scheduled to begin in April. Poland says more than 100,000 Poles were killed in the massacres by Ukrainian nationalists. Thousands of Ukrainians also died in reprisal killings. Warsaw has long demanded free access to sites where those killed are believed to have been buried, so that they can be exhumed for proper funerals. EU PRESIDENCY Poland took up the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union this month, with bolstering the bloc's security and commitment to Ukraine high on the agenda as leaders look ahead to Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president. Tusk said that Poland would work to speed up Ukraine's accession to the bloc during its six-month presidency. Ukraine, which faces a Russian push along front lines, has also requested more weaponry. ""We discussed today our defence, arms supplies, and weapons production,"" Zelenskiy said. ""We talked about the appropriate investments, which we need so much, without which it is very difficult to hold the frontline,"" Zelenskiy said. Ukraine produces 33-34% of all weapons domestically, Zelenskiy said. MASSACRES The area where the massacres took place, which was inhabited by both Poles and Ukrainians, was part of Poland before World War Two before being occupied by the Soviet Union. In 2013, the Polish parliament recognised the massacre by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) during World War Two as ""ethnic cleansing bearing the hallmarks of genocide"". Ukraine has not accepted that assertion and often refers to the Volhynia events as part of a conflict between Poland and Ukraine that affected both nations. Kyiv has said that Poland mistreated Ukrainians on its territory after the war by forcibly relocating them to other parts of the country. It also complained about the vandalism in 2015 of a monument to Ukrainian nationalist soldiers in Poland. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in an interview with European Pravda published on Wednesday that Kyiv demanded worthy commemoration of Ukrainian burials on the territory of Poland as part of a resolution.

38,What's on the ballot for Wisconsin's Feb. 18 primary and April 1 spring...,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/whats-ballot-wiscon...
Name: Link, dtype: object","Believe it or not, the next election in Wisconsin is only a month away — the spring primary on Tuesday, Feb. 18. All voters in Wisconsin will participate in the primary, since three candidates are running in a statewide race for superintendent of public instruction. Two will advance to the April 1 general election. You might have also heard about a state Supreme Court race this spring. Only two candidates are running, meaning there's no primary for that race. Depending on where you live, you may have a primary for other local, nonpartisan races on your ballot, like circuit court judges, city council members or school board members. Here's what to know about what's on the ballot in Wisconsin's spring elections, and important voting deadlines to keep in mind: Three candidates are running for state superintendent — the state's top education official. That's a statewide position, so all Wisconsin voters will participate in that primary election. Incumbent Jill Underly is seeking a second term. She's endorsed by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Jeff Wright, a Democrat and the Sauk Prairie School District superintendent, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant, are challenging Underly. The political action committee of the Wisconsin Education Association Council — the state's largest teachers' union — recommended Wright receive the organization's endorsement. Kinser declined to tell the Journal Sentinel her party affiliation. She previously led Wisconsin's Rocketship schools, which are part of a national network of public charter schools. More: 3 candidates file paperwork to run for state superintendent of public instruction, prompting February primary Some voters may see additional primaries on their ballot, if more than two candidates are running for a local office. For example, in the Cedarburg, Hartland-Lakeside and Oak Creek-Franklin school districts, there are several candidates running for school board seats. Voters on Milwaukee's east side will see a primary of eight candidates hoping to represent the 3rd District on the Common Council, which was left vacant after the death of Ald. Jonathan Brostoff. You can always check to see which races and candidates are on your upcoming ballot by using the ""What's on my Ballot"" feature at myvote.wi.gov. Sample ballots are typically ready 21 days before state and local elections. Wisconsin voters will again determine whether the state Supreme Court remains under liberal control or switches to a conservative majority in the April 1 election. Since only two candidates are running, the race isn't on the Feb. 18 primary ballot. Liberal Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford and former Republican state attorney general Brad Schimel — who's also a conservative Waukesha County judge — are vying for the open seat. Ann Walsh Bradley, a longtime liberal justice, is retiring from the court. The past two Supreme Court elections in Wisconsin had primaries, including a four-candidate race in 2023 with two liberal and two conservative candidates. More: Missing all the political ads? With no primary, Supreme Court race will kick into high gear All voters in Wisconsin are also set to weigh in on a statewide referendum question April 1, asking whether Wisconsin's photo identification requirement to vote should be enshrined in the state constitution. Republicans scheduled the referendum question for the April 1 election in part because they're concerned the state Supreme Court could overturn Wisconsin's voter ID law. They have pointed out Crawford's work as an attorney representing plaintiffs challenging the state's voter ID law. More: Wisconsin voters saw 5 statewide referendums in 2024. They might see 4 more in 2025. Here's what they are. Voters will also make their final selections for local, nonpartisan offices, including circuit court judges, municipal judges, county executives, county supervisors, city council members and school board members. Some local governments or school districts may place funding referendums on the April 1 ballot. More: Brookfield residents will see a $6 million operating referendum on the April 1 ballot Wisconsin has same-day voter registration, meaning you can register at your polling place Feb. 18 or April 1.

39,Why California crews aren't relying on the ocean to douse wildfires,"0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-california-crew...
Name: Link, dtype: object","With Southern California fire crews struggling to contain some of the multiple wildfires near the Los Angeles area, you may have noticed that, for the most part, they are avoiding the use of the Pacific Ocean to help quell the blazes. A major obstacle in the fight has been the low water supplies. While there have been some instances of aerial firefighters scooping water out of the Pacific Ocean––along with retardant, of course––to dump onto the wildfires, it is not heavily used for the most part. SEE ALSO: Animal rescuers care for L.A. wildfire evacuees - dogs, donkeys, horses Why is that? Basically, there are multiple reasons why fire crews are reluctant to use water from the ocean. Helicopter carrying water bucket to extinguish the wildfire. (Toa55/Getty Images/2016576199-170667a) On Canada's West Coast, British Columbia is ""fortunate to have an abundance of freshwater sources along our coastal region that can be used to fight wildfires,"" according to a statement from B.C.'s Ministry of Forests, emailed to The Weather Network. According to Technology.org, the main issue is the corrosion effects on firefighting equipment from the salt content in the ocean water. Water tanks and other pieces of firefighter equipment have numerous parts that are made from metal, which will corrode from salt water. La Jolla, Calif. (Art Wager/Getty Images:1908609423-170667a) The BC Wildfire Service will use salt water if necessary, but due to its potential corrosiveness on firefighting equipment, it will always opt for fresh water, the B.C. ministry added. ""Since the province does not regularly use salt water to fight wildfires in B.C., data on its impact to the landscape or its effectiveness is limited,"" said the forestry ministry. When comparing the two types of water, fresh does a better job at putting out wildfires, mainly because of the properties it contains. Salt can reduce the cooling effect of water, reducing its efficiency at lowering the temperature of the fire. And the source of the extinguishment can differ, depending on the type of fire. Certain, specialized fires may require specialty extinguishing agents, such as foam or dry chemicals. (piola666/ iStock/ Getty Images Plus) Firefighters have to consider logistics when choosing fresh or salt water. Ocean water isn’t practical most times. Many wildfires burn far away from the coast, often in remote areas. Transporting ocean water to those locations would be cumbersome and complex at a time when speed is crucial. As well, there is the issue of electrical conductivity. Salt water is a suitable conductor of electricity. Using it on electrical fires can be hazardous since it could elevate the risk of electrical shock. “There is one other reason not to use salt water to fight fires, and that is that salt water is highly conductive,"" said Ze’ev Gedalof, associate professor at the University of Guelph, in a recent interview with The Weather Network. (BC Wildfire Service) “If you've got live power lines and salt water together, that's dangerous for the people who are fighting the fire. There is a real risk of shock.” The environmental impacts have been documents. Similar to road salt runoff, ocean water could also seep into rivers and streams. All of that may then impact wildlife. To simulate the impacts of salt and fresh water on coastal forests, scientists used a freshwater woodland at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) as part of a project to unravel the future effects of sudden deluges. Chesapeake Bay.

Salty water from Chesapeake Bay was inserted into tanks and splashed on the forest soil surface, quick enough to saturate the soil. After 30 hours of exposure to the salt water in June 2004, scientists started to notice changes in the forest. ""The leaves of tulip poplar in the forests started to brown in mid-August, several weeks earlier than normal. By mid-September, the forest canopy was bare, as if winter had set in. These changes did not occur in a nearby plot that we treated the same way, but with fresh water rather than sea water,"" said Patrick Megonigal, ecosystem ecologist and associate director of research at SERC, in an article he wrote for The Conversation, published on Jan. 13, 2025.

According to Megonigal, sea level rise has increased by an average of about eight inches (203 millimetres) globally over the past century. The result has seen salty water being pushed into U.S. forests, farms and neighbourhoods that had previously had only been exposed to fresh water. ""As the rate of sea level rise accelerates, storms push sea water ever farther onto the dry land, eventually killing trees and creating ghost forests, a result of climate change that is widespread in the U.S. and globally,"" Megonigal wrote in the Jan. 13 article.

The recent Los Angeles-area wildfires have devastated the region, destroying property en masse and leaving 16 dead. The Palisades Fire was behind five of the deaths, and the Eaton Fire was behind the other 11, according to an update from the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. “This matter is being worked out, and through appropriate channels, we have offered our assistance to the American side.

41,"Zelenskyy, Macron discuss Western troop deployment in Ukraine before German...","0    https://www.yahoo.com/news/zelenskyy-macron-di...
Name: Link, dtype: object","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he has held further discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of Western troops deploying in Ukraine to safeguard any peace deal ending the nearly three-year war with Russia. Zelenskyy’s disclosure came before an official visit to Kyiv on Tuesday by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. He arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit following a meeting in Warsaw on Monday with his counterparts from France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland. Germany and the four other countries are Europe’s five top military spenders. Pistorius told German news agency dpa that his visit to Kyiv aims to underscore Germany’s strong support for Ukraine at a time when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s term beginning next week looks set to bring deep changes to Washington’s policy on the war. Pistorius said that his visit “is a signal that Germany, as the biggest NATO country in Europe, stands by Ukraine — not alone, but with the group of five and many other allies.” Trump has criticized the cost of the war for U.S. taxpayers through major military aid packages for Ukraine, and vowed to bring the conflict to a swift end. He also has made it clear that he wants to shift more of the Ukraine burden onto Europe. Macron prompted an outcry from other leaders, and he appeared isolated on the European stage, after his remarks almost a year ago floated the possibility of putting Western troops in Ukraine. Pistorius told reporters in Kyiv that the Warsaw meeting didn’t discuss Macron’s remarks about troop deployments. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine needs security guarantees to bolster any peace agreement — an issue he said late Monday that he discussed with the French leader. “As one of these guarantees, we discussed the French initiative to deploy military contingents in Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “We considered practical steps for its implementation, possible expansion and involvement of other countries in this process.” Potentially sending European troops as peacekeepers to Ukraine is fraught with risk. Such a move may not deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again in the future, which is the fear of Ukrainian officials, and could drag European countries into a direct confrontation with Moscow. That, in turn, could pull NATO — including the United States — into a conflict. Russia’s bigger army has largely pinned Ukrainian forces on the defensive along the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Ukraine’s defenses are creaking in the eastern Donetsk region amid a Russian onslaught. Zelenskyy said Ukraine has more than 100 brigades on the battlefield and each of them requires equipment replenishment before potentially increasing the number of troops through a wider mobilization. Ukraine has built up a domestic arsenal of long-range drones and missiles that it uses to hit targets on Russian soil far behind the front line. The targets are usually infrastructure that supports the Russian war effort, such as arms depots, oil refineries and manufacturing plants. The Ukrainian General Staff on Tuesday claimed a series of successful attacks on three Russian regions and Russia’s Republic of Tatarstan, reaching some 1,100 kilometers (almost 700 miles) into Russia. It said in a report that among the targets struck were an oil refinery and a fuel storage depot, a chemical plant producing ammunition, and two anti-aircraft missile systems. Russian authorities did not report any major damage or injuries from recent aerial attacks. The Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of firing six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles, six U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and 31 drones at Russia’s Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine. All the missiles and drones were shot down by air defense systems, the ministry claimed in an online statement, but it said that the attack ""will not go unanswered.” Russia has repeatedly threatened Ukraine and the West with retaliation for the use of Western-supplied longer-range weapons to strike Russian soil. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"
